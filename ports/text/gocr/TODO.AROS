Problem: Gocr doesn't work with PNG files.

Gocr tries to convert PNG files by a call of pngtopnm with popen(). 
It looks like popen() doesn't use the shell search path to find
pngtopnm.

An attempt to call Gocr with PNG file from a bash shows the error:
pngtopnm: I/O error writing packed row to raw PBM file.
