	* Makefile: added for GNU/linux. It should work relatively well
	out of the box.

	* *.cpp: enclosed #include <windows.h> in a #ifdef WIN32
	preprocessing.

	* *.cpp: all variables turned into file scope vars using static.

	* *.cpp: fixed all MSVCisms incompatible with ISO C++
	standard. This includes for(int i=0;...) {} scope of the i
	var, and many (many many) warnings about explicit casting
	missing. References to UINT replaced by GLuint or GLint where
	appropriate.

	* *.cpp: replaced the gl\ path by  GL/ to respect case sensitivity
	of Unix platforms.

	* LICENSE, *.cpp: Added legal headers to code files and data
	files. Added the complete GNU GPLv2 License to LICENSE file 
	
	* scene06.h, scene07.h: Moved object data definition to a
	specific header ${filename}-data.h that is only included by the
	sceneXX.cpp file that requires it.

	* scene04.cpp: Sleep(20) call replaced by usleep for non WIN32
	platforms which conforms to BSD4.3 standard. This may be replaced
	by nanosleep which is defined by POSIX.1b and thus i probably
	more widespread among unixes.

	* utils.cpp: tochar(int) returns '\0' when not a digit.

	* utils.cpp: tostr(), replaced all NULL assignment to '\0'
	assignment.
	
	* glxsglut.cpp: changed Fullscreen code to fallback to
	glutFullscreen because Game Mode seems to fail with many glut
	configs. The glutFullscreen solution is not as nice as the game
	mode but at least it respect the user's wish to have a FS
	application running.

	* ReadMe.txt: Added Build instructions for MSVC and Unix. Added
	the License section.
