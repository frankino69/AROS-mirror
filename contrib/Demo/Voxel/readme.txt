                       -VESA 2.0 Voxel Landscape-
                     *written by Tobias Tworek 1997* 
 
It is not a very fast code (~45 fp/s P5200MMX) and it never was
supposed to be one, but only a little test to figure out how voxel works.
Seems to be not difficult, so there are hardly any comments.
It tooked me 15 minutes to write the main voxelstuff so there could be
some bugs.
By the way: I do _NOT_ feel responsible for any kind of damage caused
by this code!
To compile the sources you'll need Watcom C/C++ 10.X.
It was tested with Dos4G(W), Pmode/W and  my own LSD/PMPRO Extender without
any problems.
Corel Draw (Photopaint) 7 is a nice tool to do height- and colormaps.

Keyboard Control:

Press....

Q                  to increase voxel size
A                  to decrease voxel size
+                  to increase height
-                  to decrease height
Return             to interpolate heightmap
UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to fly around 
ESC                to quit


An email would be nice if you like it (or not).... 

jscheele@fhzinfo.fh-bielefeld.de     (don't know how long that works...)


If you've optimized the code and/or added sprites or shading please
let me know (or send me your changes).
