INTRODUCTION

This is experimental Python 2.5.2 AROS port intended to be built on AROS. It 
contains the following modules:

* array
* cmath
* math
* struct
* time
* operator
* weakref
* testcapi
* random
* collections
* itertools
* strop

This port doesn't support dynamically linked extensions.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

You need to have gcc, binutils, collect-aros, abc-shell, make, coreutils, sed,
grep and diffutils installed to build Python.

You need filesystem with working symbolic (soft) links to install Python. SFS
will do just fine.

Steps needed to build and install Python:

1. Download Python 2.5.2 sources
2. Unpack them and apply Python-2.5.2-aros.diff patch
3. Copy patched sources to your AROS partition
4. Run abc-shell (SYS:Development/bin/sh) and cd to Python source directory
5. ./configure --prefix=/usr --without-threads --disable-shared LDFLAGS=-nix
6. touch Include/Python-ast.h Python/Python-ast.c
7. make
8. make install

Installation directory is specified in step 5 in the --prefix option value.

Step 6 is needed only if Python is not already installed in /usr.

Don't worry about "Please insert home|opt|lib64" requesters appearing during
build process, simply cancel them.

Tested on:

* AROS linux-x86_64
* AROS pc-i386 (FFS Intl) - installation not completed due to symbolic links 
not working
