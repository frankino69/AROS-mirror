You'll find here two sets of images to use with MUIBuilder.

'Chesnot_Hires_8' : by Jerome Chesnot

'Tobi_Small_8'    : by Tobias Ferber

These images use the MagicWB palette.

To add some images of your own, you just have to draw them and
put them in your own directory in the Images/Directory.
All images must have the SAME size !!!!
