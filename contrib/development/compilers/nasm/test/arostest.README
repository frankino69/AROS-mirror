The simple test program 'arostest.s' may be assembled using the command line:
  nasm -f elf arostest.s

  this will produce an object file, arostest.o

  This object file may be linked with the 'ld' linker using the following command line:
  ld -r -o arostest arostest.o

  and this will produce the file 'arostest' which is an executable file and may be run.

  The operation of the test program is
    create a console window from a description string,
    output a text message,
    input upto 80 characters of text,
    and close when an enter is pressed.
