NAME
    ARoach - cockroaches hide under your windows


SYNOPSIS
    ARoach ROACHES/K/N,SPEED/K/N,SQUISH/S,SCREEN=PUBSCREEN/K,HELP/S


DESCRIPTION
    ARoach displays disgusting cockroaches on your screen.  These creepy
    crawlies  scamper  around  until  they  find a window to hide under.
    Whenever  you move or resize a window, the exposed orthopteras again
    scamper for cover.

    ARoach  is  based  on  Xroach  for  X-Windows.  It requires at least
    AmigaDOS Release 2.

    The  roaches live in a backdrop window behind all other windows.  So
    if  your Workbench window is NOT a backdrop window and you don't see
    any roaches, look behind it!

    To  quit the program, you can either close its window, break it with
    CTRL-C or squish all roaches with the mouse (see option SQUISH).


OPTIONS
    All  options  can  be  given  either  as  Tooltypes  or command line
    options.  Tooltypes are parsed _exactly_ like options given from the
    shell.

    ROACHES=<n>
        This is the number of the little critters.  Default is 10.

        Note:   The  BOB  routines  of  graphics.library  can use a fair
        amount of stack with large numbers of objects.  So the number of
        roaches  is  currently  limited  to  1000,  which  is OK for the
        current (internal) stack size of 16000 Bytes.

    SPEED=<n>
        Use  the  given speed for the insects instead of the default 20.
        For example, in winter the speed should be set to 5.  In summer,
        30 might be about right.

    SQUISH
        Enables  roach  squishing.   Point and shoot with the left mouse
        button.

    PUBSCREEN=<string>
        Drop  the  roaches  on  the  given public screen.  Make sure the
        screen is nearby, so you can hear the screams.

    HELP
        Displays a short help text.


EXAMPLE
        ARoach ROACHES 5 SPEED=30 SQUISH PUBSCREEN="DOPUS.1"

    gives  birth  to  5  squishable  roaches  of speed 30, living on the
    public screen of DirectoryOPUS.


BUGS
    As given by the ROACHES option. Default is 10.

    Under  AmigaOS  3.0,  there  is some garbage under a window when you
    move  it  away.  This is a bug with graphics.library and interleaved
    bitmaps, I suppose.
