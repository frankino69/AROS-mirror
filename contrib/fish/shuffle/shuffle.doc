Shuffle was programmed using SAS/C 6.0 on an A4000/40 under
OS 3.0. However, Shuffle needs OS2.04 (Version 37+) or later.
Special thanks to Jan van den Baard for his "GadToolsBox", which
was used in this program.

***********************************************************

Shuffle is a small game that gives you something to think.
The  program makes a copy of the Workbench Screen, splits it
up in a number of pieces, cuts out one piece  and shuffles 
the other pieces by moving them around.
Your task is to get the pieces in order again by moving
them  yourself.

Once the program has started, a window with some controls
is opened.

   "Start"         starts the game
   "Tiles"         choose the number of tiles
                   4x4 (16 tiles)
                   8x4
                   8x8
                   16x8
                   16x16(256 tiles)
   "Shuffle"       How many moves should be made to
                   mix up the screen
   "Numbers"       display a ordinal number on each tile
   
   "Move Tiles / Move Gap" 
                   controls the movement of the
                   tiles. If you choose  "Move Tiles" 
                   (the default)the cursor keys will move
                   a tile into the direction you pressed, e.g.
                   if you press "cursor down", the tile above
                   the gap will move down (and the gap moves
                   up). If You choose "Move Gap" the cursor
                   keys are moving the gap in the direction
                   you pressed, e.g. if  you press "cursor down"
                   the gap will move down (and the tile under the
                   gap moves up).
                   
Once you press "Start" the screen is shuffled. During the
game you can press the following keys :

         Cursor keys       Move the tiles
         HELP  (or H key)  Display a help message
         S  key            Display the Score
         A  key            About shuffle...
         ESC or Q key      Quit game

         Left Mousebutton  If you click on a tile
                           left,right,down or up to the
                           gap, the tile will move to the
                           gap and vice versa.
