Lyr-O-Mat was programmed using SAS/C 6.0 on an A4000/40 under
OS 3.0. However, Lyr-O-Mat needs OS2.04 (Version 37+) or later.
Special thanks to Jan van den Baard for his "GadToolsBox", which
was used in this program.

***********************************************************

Lyr-O-Mat is a program designed to enjoy and amuse the user.
The program attempts to reach this goal by displaying stupid
statements, insolent requests and other silly sentences.
These sentences are generated at random out from a sentence
pattern list which may (should) contain wordclass names, which 
are replaced with a random word from the word list of this
class. To explain this please follow the instructions of the

***********************************************************

                 Quickstart

1. run the Lyr-O-Mat program by double-clicking its program
   icon. You will then recognize the program window with several
   lists and gadgets and the output window(which may be resized or
   moved).
2. Select "Project->Load->Patterns & Classes" from the menu (right
   Mousebutton menu), then select the file "english_demo.wds", which
   should reside in the same directory as this manual.
   The english database will now be loaded and displayed in the
   lists.
3. click the "Generate"-button (or press the "g"-Key or the white space
   key on the keyboard) to generate a sentence. Lyr-O-Mat picks a
   random pattern from the pattern list, replaces classes with a
   random word from this class and displays the generated sentence.
 
***********************************************************

The sentence may look like this (from english_demo.wds)

  "10: impossible computer discs can be sold today in El Peso."
  
How does Lyr-O-Mat compose this rubbish ?

  Looking at the pattern list you find at No. 10
  
  "10: >adj >nouns can be >wds-4 >future in >place."
  
You can recognize that this pattern contains normal words as
well as class names (introduced with the ">"-Character).
When Lyr-O-Mat generates a sentence, it is looking for ">"
characters in the pattern and searching the wordclass list if
such a class is known. If it is, the classname in the
pattern is replaced with a random word from the associated
wordlist.
Note: the items in the wordclass list do not have the
      introducing ">". 
Note: Words from a wordlist may contain wordclass names.
  
***********************************************************

        Adding wordclasses and words
        
To add a wordclass click the "Add"-button of the wordclass
list, type in the name and press "return".
To add a word to an existing wordclass click the classname
in the classlist, click the "Add"-button of the wordlist and
type in the new word.
To remove an item from any of the 3 lists click on the item
in the list and click the corresponding "Delete"-button.

Note: If you delete a wordclass, the corresponding wordlist 
      will be deleted, too.
      
***********************************************************
    
        Writing a database using an editor
        
This is much faster if you intend to make a large database
on your own. The format of a data file is like this


Words.File
; remark
this is a pattern
another pattern
#wordclass
?word of "wordclass"
?word of "wordclass"
#anotherclass
?word of "anotherclass"
?word of "anotherclass"

The introducing string "Words.File" must be present in the first
line, because Lyr-O-Mat searches for it to identify the file as
one of it's own files.

Classes  are introduced with a "#" character and
words    are introduces with a "?" character.

Note: the "#","?" and ";"- characters MUST be in the
      first column. If they are not there Lyr-O-Mat treats the
      line as a pattern.

***********************************************************
      
                 Load and Save
                 
Load and save functions are separately available for patterns,
classes and "patterns & classes". 
Note: the "load" functions are clearing all lists before loading
      a file, the "append" functions are appending files to
      the current database. 

***********************************************************

                 Pattern- / Textmode
                 
The Gadget Text/Pattern determines how Lyr-O-Mat works:

"Pattern" generates a single sentence from a random picked pattern.
"Text"    generates a sentence from each pattern in the order of
          the pattern list.

***********************************************************

If you like Lyr-O-Mat you may send bug reports, money, disks,
jewellery and other gifts to me. If you don't like it you
are encouraged to send me such things too.

Enjoy !!
