CFN is public domain. Do with it whatever you want. I am not taking any
responsibility for the program, you are using CFN at YOUR OWN RISK !




What is CFN ?
-------------

CFN takes a lot of typing from you, when you are working in the Shell
and have to type long file- or directorynames. It's enough to type the
first few characters of the name and to press the TAB key. CFN completes
the filename immediately, but just as long as there is just one
possibility. Let's have a look at an example:

Say, you have a directory with the following files:

contents.doc
MegaProgrammiximo.readme
MegaProgrammiximo.c
MegaProgrammiximo
MegaProgrammiximoPictures/ superpicture1    [ <-- subdirectory ]
                          superpicture2

Now, you want to read the ...readme file (that is what it is for :)
Assuming, you are in the Shell, simply type:

> more M

and press the "TAB"-key.
The result:

> more MegaProgrammiximo

as there is only one possibility to complete the name so far.
Now, type ".r" and press the TAB key again:

> more MegaProgrammiximo.readme

Simply press RETURN and you're ready !


The whole thing also works with directories, e.g.:

> show M                     <TAB-key>
> show MegaProgrammiximo
> show MegaProgrammiximoP    <TAB-key>
> show MegaProgrammiximoPictures/
> show MegaProgrammiximoPictures/s  <TAB-key>
> show MegaProgrammiximoPictures/superpicture
> show MegaProgrammiximoPictures/superpicture1   <RETURN>



History
-------

This method to complete filenames is common in UNIX-shells. As you get
accustomed to it very quickly, I often hit the TAB key on my AMIGA
at home without any effect (apart from the inverted "I")...
So I looked for a program that adds this feature to the AmigaShell,
but couldn't find one. I guess, something like that exists, but I'll
find it tomorrow (according to Murphy) ;-)
Well, then I spent one night at my AMIGA and wrote CFN myself. To 
include the filename completion into the system in a clean way, you 
normally had to put very much effort in it (program a new Shell).
But with some tricks, you get it working with just two little programs.

Perhaps, someone wants to improve or rewrite the program or have
other good ideas (e.g. making a commodity out of it) .?
For interested programmers, I have included the sourcecode.
(I use CFN with Kickstart 39.106, Workbench 39.29)



Restrictions
------------

A filename have to be typed without any interruptions to be recognized
by CFN. In other words, if you type half of the name, doing some
business in another window and then type the remaining part, CFN will
not be able to complete the name correctly. But as you normally stay
in one window while typing a filename, that's not too bad... It may hit
you worse, that you are not able to edit the typed name with the cursor
keys, but only with the backspace key. (You CAN of course edit it,
but the trick with the TAB key does not work in that case !)
BTW: Filenames that end with ".info", are ignored.

As the Shell stays the same and keeps ALL its functions, CFN is
nevertheless a wonderful supplement for the Shell.



Installation
------------

Finally, let's start !
The installation is simple:

insert the line

    cfn_newshell

into your file

  S:Shell-Startup

and the line

    run >NIL: cfn

into your file

  S:User-Startup


The programs "cfn" and "cfn_newshell" should stay in your path, e.g.
in the "C:"-directory.


That's all.

And now, happy TABbing !
