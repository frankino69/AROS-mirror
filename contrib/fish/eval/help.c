"Exponent representation\n"
"-----------------------\n"
"If you are working in a base above 14, use a \\ instead of an E for\n"
"scientific notation.  E.g. If you are working in base 16,\n"
"A\\10 = hex A times 10^10, where both 10's are in hex.  So the\n"

"-----------------------------------\n"
"The default input base can be overridden in typical C fashion for hex:\n"
"0xffee = hex FFEE.  However a preceding \"0\" does NOT convert to octal.\n"
"See below for converting to octal.  To specify any base as an override,\n"
"use \\bxxxxx.xxxExxx where b is a single character representing the base\n"
"('2'-'9', '0'=10, 'A'-'Z'=11-36), x is a digit in the base, and E (or\n"
"\"\\\" for bases greater than 14) is used for scientific notation.\n"
"Example:  \\2101e101 would be 101e101 base 2, having a decimal equivalent\n"
"of 5*2^5=160.  Other special override prefixes:  &h=hex, &b=binary,\n"
"&o=octal, &d=decimal, $=hex.\n"
"To override the default output base, put any base prefix (e.g. 0x, &h)\n"
"with a space after it at the beginning of the expression line.\n"
"\n"
"The \"literal variable\" character\n"
"--------------------------------\n"
"If you are working in a default input base where there may be confusion\n"
"as to whether an input is a variable or a number, use ! in front of the\n"
"input to force the variable value:  E.g. In base 16, A = 10, but\n"
"!A = the value of the variable \"A\".\n"
