This is my first venture into public domain software, and while I hate
dealing with rules and licenses and all that, I decided that I had to
protect myself, so I am using the GNU public license agreement to set
the terms for redistributing this software.  Please read the GNU public
license agreement in the file, COPYING.  In sum, the license allows you
to freely copy and modify this software, but you can't pull any dirty
tricks like using it for profit or calling it your own or making up your
own restrictions on it if you redistribute it.

This distribution comes with the full source code to Eval, which is
written for ANSI compliant C compilers.  This distribution also includes
an executable version of Eval for the Amiga, with a tool-type icon that
automatically opens a window for it.  The Eval source is easily ported
to other systems.  See below.

Using Eval
----------
Documentation is built into Eval.  Just run the program.


Amiga version
-------------
The Amiga version was compiled using Manx C 5.2a.  It uses the Amiga
IEEE libraries, so it auto-detects the FPU.  It should work on any Amiga.
If it bombs from your CLI, try increasing your stack size.


The source code
---------------
In the source directory of this archive are nine C modules, one header
file, and several make files.  If you would like to add custom constants
to Eval, look at eval.c.  If you would like to add custom functions to
Eval, look at funcs.c.

To compile on Unix:   Use Makefile.unx

To compile on a Mac:  There is no Makefile, but I had no trouble
                      compiling all modules with Think C 5.0.
                      I threw all of the modules into my project window,
                      added the "ANSI" library, put eval.c at the top,
                      and selected "Build Application."

To compile on Amiga:  Use Makefile.asa (SAS C 6.X)
                       or Makefile.ama (Manx C 5.X)

To compile on IBM-PC: Use Makefile.tcc (Borland C 2.X)


If you would like an Eval executable for an IBM PC or a Macintosh
(though hopefully you've come to your senses and bought an Amiga ;-),
and you don't have access to a C compiler, contact me.

That's it.  I hope Eval is of use to you.
