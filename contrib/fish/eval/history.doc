Version history

Version 1.00 (9/88)

Eval was originally written to be a flexible PC calculator.  Since I
work in a lab where bessel functions are freqently used, I placed
emphasis on putting bessel functions in the code.  I also wanted
something more powerful than a simple mock-up of an actual calculator.
And since I own an Amiga but work with IBM PC clones, I used ANSI C for
portability.  This version stayed fairly constant over four years, and I
ran it on unix, VMS, and PC (Amiga, IBM, Mac) platforms.


Version 1.10 (approx 1/93)

A friend of mine asked me to put Eval in the public domain, so I figured
I'd better dress it up a little.  I added more flexible output (user
specified precision), automatic pausing every 22 lines, and the ability
to specify input and output in any number base.  I also rewrote the math
library using my own coding (with help from Abromowitz and Stegun :-) so
that I would not infringe upon Numerical Recipes in C's copyright when I
distributed my source code.  Now Eval is entirely my own doing (not
necessarily a good thing ;-).


Version 1.11  (approx 2/93)

A version I never released.  I added better script support.


Version 1.12  (4-9-93)

I added a default write directory and read path for scripts, and I added
the ability to specify a certain page of help.
