    Updates to MemSnap 1.1:

    Now uses small window, where dragbar is whole window except snap gadget;
    Has two states, small and large; menu added to choose states and quit;
    Tooltype: SMALL=<what> where what is YES or NO, determines initial state.
    When memsnap is small, clicking in snapshot gadget makes it large.

    MemSnapII is really neat when started small with a small font, as a small
    memory monitor. The small font tracers_bold is included for use.


    MemSnap version 1.1 (2/93)
    --------------------------

    Updates to MemSnap 1.0:

	Now defaults to using topaz font. Font may be specified by tooltypes:

		FONTNAME=<name>		e.g. FONTNAME=courier.font
		FONTHEIGHT=<size>	e.g. FONTHEIGHT=15

	(Note: font will be scaled to size if given size doesn't exist).
	Can use tooltypes also to specify where window opens:

		LEFTEDGE=<num>
		TOPEDGE=<num>

	You can use Lens or something to determine preferred position of
	window to set in tooltypes.

        All these changes can only be used if starting from Workbench; so, if
	starting MemSnap at bootup, shove it into WBStartup.
 

    MemSnap version 1.0 (3/92)
    --------------------------

    Nothing new here, this is based upon a program called Memeter that
    I often used under 1.3, but that program crashed under my ZKicked 2.0,
    so I've written this to fill the gap. This only runs under 2.0.

    It's use (apart from telling you free memory) is to indicate what
    memory a program uses, and whether it frees all its memory.

    It can be started from Workbench or CLI, and takes no arguments.
    It opens up a window with three columns, showing chip, fast and total
    memory.

    Under "Current" is the current amount of free memory.
    Under "Snapshot" is memory available at time of snapshot.
    Under "Used" is memory used since snapshot, ie. snapshot - used.

    To snapshot memory, click anywhere on the line containing the
    column headings.

    Quick example:
    	Start memsnap.
    	Open drawer containing clock and snapshot current memory.
    	Start Clock program.
    		...	on my system it uses about 43K
    	Close down clock program.
    	See if "used" column is empty ( => nothing used since snapshot).

    Other features: (first two defunct in MemSnapII)
        *    Iconifies with zoom gadget.
        *    Uses screen font as set in preferences (and so hopefully copes
	     with all fonts). Proportional fonts may or may not look right.
        *    Has a version string (wow!).
        *    It's small, FREE, and comes with it's C source.

    This is my first attempt at OS2-friendly programming. Thanks to
    author of the original memeter, WallyWare(!?).
