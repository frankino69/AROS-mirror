                        Amigaholics Club International.
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We are a user group dedicated to beginners, PD software and generally hacking
the Amiga.  (Strictly NO Pirates).

Membership is free as we do not officially meet as a club due to our wide
dispersion.  (At present, over nine countries).

Instead of meetings, members keep together through our disk magazine AHI.
I am the one with the worn-out pinkies.  Kevin Bryan, the Editor.

The mag. is written mostly by myself, Trevor McLoughlin and Paul Kelly although
I am happy to say that more and more of the material is being supplied by the
other members.  This great program for instance.  That is what we want.  Lots
and lots of nice Amy enthusiasts willing to share their enthusiasm with others
be it a program, an article, some music, or maybe just a cry for assistance...

If you think any of that sounds like you then please get in touch with me at;
