                        MemoMaster V2 Doc.
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MM2 (MemoMaster V2) is one of those programs which can be used
to avoid forgetting events such as your wedding anniversary.
Instal it on the disk you generally boot with, record all those
birthdays and any other events you feel you might need reminding
of and you will be warned about them when they approach.

Installation.

Beginners:

     Boot with the Workbench disk you wish to copy MM2 onto then
     double-click on the 'Install_MM' Icon.
     A MEMOS directory will be created if it doesn't already exist
     and MM2 will be copied over to your disk along with an Icon
     with suitable colours for your version of Workbench.

     The startup-sequence will be modified for you to automatically
     run MM2 every time you boot up.

   ** MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR WORKBENCH DISK **

     Please note;  You will need to make some space on a standard
     1.3 Workbench disk to make room for MM2.  I suggest you delete
     the contents of the PREFS drawer or some unwanted UTILITIES.

     Workbench2 users will have just enough room on their WB disks
     but it is still recommended that you make some room for MEMOS.

Experienced users:

     Put the program (MM2) into a location included in your PATH
     list. Insert the following two lines in your startup-
     sequence (after the PATH has been set up)-
          ASSIGN MEMOS: volume:dir/subdir
          MM2 check
     (NB - at present the word check must be in lower case
     letters). You may want to set up a configuration file in
     the directory in the above ASSIGN command but this is
     unlikely to be necessary. See the Colour Configuration
     section near the end of this document if the program seems
     to use the wrong colours from your preferences palette. You
     should now find that the program will run whenever you boot
     using the volume with MM2 installed. If no memos are due
     for a reminder, you will not be bothered by the program,
     otherwise you will get a requester containing the
     reminders. To run the program outside of startup-sequence
     (to maintain your list of memos) type "mm2" at a CLI/SHELL
     prompt or click on its icon from workbench.

Memo fields.

     Date.
          Date in format dd-mmm-yy eg 23-feb-92. You can leave
          the year part blank or put in other characters if you
          like. You might do this if the memo refers to an event
          which occurs annually and you do not want the year
          recorded for some reason. For example, you might want
          to record a birthday but not know (or want to
          publicise) the year.

     Notice.
          The number of days notice you require for this
          particular event. You might need 10 days to organise
          a birthday present but only need a couple of days
          notice of an agreed date to make a phone call. You can
          put values up to 99 here. Please remember that you
          will only get the reminder if you use your computer
          and only then if MM2 gets run.

     Type.
          At present the program only recognises two types of
          memo. Annual ones (type = 'a' or 'A') and others. The
          only difference is that annual ones will pop up
          irrespective of the year part of the date field whereas
          you will only get reminded about others in the period
          specified by the full date and the notice required.

     Text.
          60 characters of free text.

MM2 specific gadgets.

     There are 18 custom gadgets on the MM2 window. A group of
     6 positions for displaying memos and 12 'action' gadgets in
     two rows.

     The memo display gadgets can be clicked on to highlight
     memos to be acted on using some of the 'action' gadgets.

     The upper row of action gadgets are concerned with movement
     around your list of memos and (left to right) have the
     following effects
          Move to beginning of list.
          Move back towards the beginning by 6 memos.
          Move back 1 memo.
          Move forward 1 memo.
          Move forward 6 memos.
          Move to end of list.

     The lower row functions are as follows.
          - ADD displays a requester allowing you to add a new
          memo.
          - EDIT displays a requester allowing you to edit an
          existing memo. This will appear for each memo
          highlighted when the gadget is clicked on.
          - DELETE displays a requester asking you to confirm
          that you really wish to remove a memo from the list.
          This will appear once for each memo highlighted when
          the gadgets is clicked on.
          - CHECK looks through the list of memos and displays
          a requester to show any which are due. These are the
          ones which would be displayed if the program had been
          run using the command line "mm2 check". You will need
          to use this gadget particularly if you have started
          mm2 from workbench.
          - SHRINK removes the main mm2 window from the display
          and replaces it with a small substitute. You can move
          the small one out of the way in the normal manner by
          dragging the title bar. Clicking on the central
          portion of the window will restore the main mm2
          window. If you then SHRINK again, the small window
          will reappear where you left it last time.
          - HELP puts mm2 into HELP mode. (The gadget stays
          highlighted to indicate this). If you now click on any
          of the custom gadgets or on the close gadget the
          program will display some help on the use of that
          gadget.

Colour configuration.
     Most people tend to leave their workbench colours untouched
     after the novelty of changing them has worn off. If you
     normally use a custom palette you can configure MM2 to work
     properly even.

     Set up a file named "MEMOS:MMASTER.CONFIG" containing just
     4 characters. These characters should be some combination
     of "0", "1", "2" and "3" eg "0123". If you run an eight
     colour workbench you can probably use numbers from 4 to 7
     as well. By amending this file you can alter the colour
     numbers used for text and boxes etc. by the program. For
     example, changing "0123" to "1023" reverses the use of
     colours 0 and 1 as set up in preferences. Trial and error
     should produce an acceptable combination of colours.

Compilation.
     If DICE (by Matt Dillon) is your C compiler, you can
     compile the program for yourself by typing DMAKE in a
     directory containing the source files, the header file and
     the makefile. Obviously your compilation environment will
     need to be set up correctly. Also, you will need to have
     the registered version since the distributable version does
     not include the C header files specifying Amiga specific
     structures etc. If you use Lattice, have a look at
     dmakefile to work out the dependencies (they are simple)
     and your LC command should compile the source files quite
     happily without any qualifiers - you will then need to work
     out the link info for BLINK (I can't help I'm afraid as I
     have took Lattice off my hard disk some time ago).

To Do.
     1. ????? (From Kev) If MemoChk() finds non-type-A memo with
     date=today, give option to delete.

     2. Menu options:-
        - Select all 'out of date'.
        - Select all of specified type.

     3. Any ideas?????
