Software in this directory and in all directories below this one works
with AROS but is usually not written by AROS developers (but also usually
modified by us). The software usually has it's own copyright which is
usually different from the APL. You cannot assume that we're responsible
for this software (we'll still accept patches for it) nor that you can
copy this software as freely as you can copy AROS itself.

If you own the rights on any software in this directory tree and you
think that we infringed on any rights you have, please send an email to
digulla@hepe.com saying so to allow us to remove your work. It's not
necessary to send Cease&Desist letters (which will probably force me to
talk to my own lawyer which will simply make two lawyers more rich and
cost us both a lot of time) nor will such letters be looked upon
favourably. You have been warned :-)
