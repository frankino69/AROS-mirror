What is this?
 Directory contains a set of diffs and this file of instructions
 on how to obtain and build the gnu gawk command for AROS.

Basic instructions:

> fetch ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gawk/gawk-3.1.3.tar.gz
> tar -zxvf gawk-3.1.3.tar.gz
> cd gawk-3.1.3
> patch -p1 < ../gawk-3.1.3-aros.diff

Now a mmakefile is generated which integrates gawk in the contrib-gnu
MetaTarget.

TODO:

I wrote a fix to tzset() using the missing_d/tzset.c emulation.
Other things were creating dummy clib functions execl(), fork(),
getpgrp(), getppid() and wait().
