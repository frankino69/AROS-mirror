Diffs for GNU pdksh. I think the fork() workaround needs some work. 
Also, this is set up to use an actual cross compiler, so an 
mmakefile.src is useless at this point. Pretty much follow the 
instructions in contrib/gnu/textutils/README to compile this.
If you need to create the cross-compiler, see contrib/gnu/gcc/README.
