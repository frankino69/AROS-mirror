Known issues with AROS port:

Locks
    List is empty.

    struct FileLock *flock;

    if (erster) next = lock;
    flock = (struct FileLock *)BADDR(next);

    if (TypeOfMem(flock) == 0) break;
    if (flock->fl_Volume != MKBADDR(dol)) break;

    Reason is that flock's members are 0.

Tasks
    Segfault when enabling "in %". It needs to be checked how this
    task time calculation can be done on AROS.
