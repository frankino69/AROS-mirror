1. INTRODUCTION

Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol for synchronizing clocks in the
Internet. NTPSync is a program that adjusts your Amiga's clock according
to a specified NTP server. Plese see http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp for
more information on NTP and a list of public NTP servers worldwide.


2. REQUIREMENTS

- an Amiga with a kickstart V37 (2.0) or higher (only tested with 3.x),
  or a PPC-Amiga with AmigaOS 4.x or MorphOS 1.x
- an AmiTCP 4.0 compatible TCP/IP stack (like Miami, AmiTCP, Genesis,
  Roadshow (OS4) or MOSNet (MOS))


3. USAGE

Please read the Disclaimer-section before installing the program.

Select the appropriate binary and rename it into "NTPSync", while
copying it to your disk.
- NTPSync_68k: AmigaOS 2.x/3.x 68k-version
- NTPSync_OS4: AmigaOS 4.x PPC-version
- NTPSync_MOS: MorphOS 1.x PPC-version

Usage: NTPSync [options] <1st server>[:port] [2nd server][:port] [...]

Where options is one or more of the following:
   -h          = Print a quick help.

   -v          = Turn on verbose mode. Causes NTPSync to print some messages
                 while sending the requests and more information about the
                 server it connected, and the offset it set the clock and
                 the roundtrip delay.

   -c          = Set the battery-clock as well as the system clock, no need
                 for "SetClock SAVE" anymore.

   -d<UTCDiff> = Difference from UTC (= GMT) in minutes.

   -t<timeout> = Time to wait for replies in seconds.
                 Note that this timeout doesn't work work for the name-server,
                 so you might prefer to specifiy the IP address instead.

For example, to set your clock according to nic.funet.fi, you would use the
following line:

NTPSync nic.funet.fi

Or if your locale.library is lying about the UTC offset, which is +2 hours:

NTPSync -d120 nic.funet.fi

Or to set the time according to ntp1.hut.fi or ntp2.hut.fi, whichever replies
first:

NTPSync ntp1.hut.fi ntp2.hut.fi


4. COMPILING

The current version is no longer compiled with SAS/C but with vbcc 0.8i
(using SAS/C for the 68k-version should still work, though). Use the
supplied Makefile to generate versions for all architectures.


5. KNOWN BUGS

There is a problem with the Daylight Saving Time. The time is set incorrectly
when the DST is in use. You must use the -d option to fix the problem
manually. If you have an idea on how to make this better, please send me
some mail.

Also, I wasn't quite sure how to use the battery.resource. I can open it OK,
but I don't know if it should be closed too somehow. Anyway, it shouldn't
cause any trouble.


6. THE AUTHOR

If you find any bugs, have any ideas, have trouble with the program, want
to say your opinion on it etc., don't hesitate to contact me by email or
normal post. You can also get the newest version directly from me. A simple
NTP server program is also in work (or actually I made one already for
debugging NTPSync).

Any feedback is welcome!

7. HISTORY

--- V2.3  - ported to AmigaOS4 and MorphOS (Frank Wille).

--- V2.2  - now supports multiple servers
          - added the verbose option
          - added the timeout option
          - can now set the battery-backed clock too
          - changed a bit the way the roundtrip delay is calculated
          - some other minor changes in the source code
          - some changes to the documentation
          - the documentation is now .txt, not .doc

--- V2.1  - fixed the date, was one day behind. I thought I fixed that in
            an older version already, but now it should be fixed for real

--- V2.0  - fixed a bug that caused the clock run very fast sometimes
          - now tries to use another port if 123 is already in use
          - now asks the local.library for the UTC diff if not given
          - some other minor changes
          - now takes the network delay into account

--- V1.1  - added version information for the 'version' command
          - added some integrity checks to the reply
          - added support for different ports
          - now prints stratum of the server when time is set
          - added the COMPILATION-section to the document
          - better error handling
          - fixed a small bug in receiving the reply
          - fixed the version number in the document
          - date was set incorrectly
          - file lengths were incorrect in the document

--- V1.0  - the initial release
