I've just spent a couple of hours testing out the latest
version, and I now have a much better list of what does and does not
work with forms.

First: Cool new things
    Hotlist - really nice method for handling it. I approve - allowing
              it to be hierarchical, and to move items up and down
              would be nice.
    View Source window being able to stay up and follow along with the
    browser. Has this always worked.
    Buttons - cool (would be nice if one had a choice of buttons or
                   "old style" text.
    More Boing - nice.
    Form elt positions almost correct!

  Good work guys!!!

    Any chance of a "Copy URL to clipboard" menu item?
    the "Reload" button seems to be ignored.
    (and version numbers are not being reset before upload, which
     would help (i.e. this version 14.1005 thinks it is 14.995))

Re forms:
 I went through the examples in:
   http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.ht
ml

Here are my notes:
  
   1) Scrolling still doesn't have any effect (as noted by stefan)
   2) It looks as if escaping of special chars "%$&" etc isn't
     done. Needs checking.
   4) Checkboxes do not have the right value sent. They get random
      garbage.
   5) When there is a single text entry field on a form, hitting
      return is supposed to submit the form (this is really
      stupid). This doesn't happen. If you do this (you have to for
      ISINDEX, anyway) make sure that it only happens if there are
      not, e.g. checkboxes on the form along with the text entry.
   10) *IMPORTANT* forms using method=GET (the default, unless POST is
       specified) don't work at all. Garbage is submitted.

   11) Clicking on delayed images to load them messes up gadget
       positions.  Some (all?) images seem to be delayed even when
       delayed loading is switched off.
   12) Looks like Stefan forgot to add in a text gadget at ISINDEX
       after taking away the UI elt. See note 5) too.


   3) Form elt positions are a few pixels higher than (I think) they
      should be.  It looks as if they are based at the text base line. I
      think the text in them should be aligned with the text baseline (i.e
      the text gadgets should be based at textbase + border width or something.
   6) When you "go back" to a filled out form, the contents should be
      preserved. They aren't.
   7) Reset buttons don't work (should set form to defaults)
   8) Neither do "clear" buttons.
   9) Multiple line text elements don't let you type in them. Also,
     the [E] button tries to start the wrong program (or has the wrong
     path, or something) on my machine. Needs to have some whay to
     configure the action of the E button in mosaic prefs.




That's it. If these are fixed, we'll be almost ready for release.
(need to integrate the AS225 stuff, and get some beta test done).
