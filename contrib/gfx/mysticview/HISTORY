  MysticView history

  1.07
    - some minor changes I forgot over the past years, sorry.
      nothing important though.

* 1.05
    - mysticview is freeware; updated texts and requesters
      accordingly.
    
  1.04
  
	- slightly improved efficiency of the scanner
	- added %n placeholder in the PICFORMAT string
	  for the picture's file format, as returned by
	  the datatype.
	- updated and fixed documentation

  1.03
    - new setting: SIMPLESCANNING. when activated, MysticView will
      add any scanned files to the filelist. no filetype detection
      takes place. later, when a file turns out to be not loadable
      as a picture, it will be silently removed from the list. this
      scanning mode is significantly faster than the default. note:
      this feature is still considered "beta" and only available
      via tooltypes.
    - supplied os3.5-icons in the "goodies" drawer.
    
  1.02
    - CTRL-F-key now immediately switches to a preset, without opening
      a filerequester first.

  1.01
  	- when in fullscreen mode and with HIDEONCLOSE enabled, MysticView
  	  quitted when the invisible button in the screen's upper left
  	  was clicked. fixed.
  	- added "Append Drag'n'Drop" option. when enabled, icons/drawers
  	  dragged onto MysticView's window will be added to the current
  	  list. tooltype is APPENDICONS.
  	- slightly improved the example preset files.


* 1.00
    - version number bumped


  0.99h
    - v1.00 feature freeze.
    - menus are being restructured.
    - fixed a bug in the buffer size calculations which caused
      the background loader to run amok sometimes.
    - mysticview and all its libraries are now using v39 exec
      memory pools again.
    - improved the install script and supplied some configs.
    - neuralnet.library wasn't installed with earlier versions.
      fixed.
    - documentation updated and improved
    - an auto filerequester was opened even with filenames
      passed in the commandline. fixed.
    - added PICFORMAT setting. it allows to specify a format
      string for the picture info display. currently defined
      are %p - pathname, %f - filename, %w - width, %h - height,
      %d - depth. default "%f - %w×%h×%d".
    - fixed APPEND option.
    - MysticView and all libraries have been recompiled with
      higher optimization levels
    - added a lot of DirectoryOpus configuration hints and
      examples
    - when a loaded presetfile contained a new SORTMODE,
      MysticView did not immediately resort the list. fixed.
    - added a slightly updated version of MystiCube to the
      distribution
    - increased neural network training threshold

    
  0.99g
    - fixed a bug in guigfx.library which caused MysticView
      to crash at exit, when the standard C= picture and ILBM
      datatypes were used for loading HAM pictures. thanks to
      Hexaae for the bug reports and debugging assistance.
    - the background loader has been rewritten from the
      scratch. the new loader is faster, and memory management
      is more efficient.
    - preloading (and caching) of multiple pictures is now
      supported. provided you have enough memory, MysticView
      can keep entire slideshows buffered in memory. Mysticview
      now reacts much better to skipping back and forwards in a
      picture list.
      this redesign also fixes a major bug (enforcer hits
      and crashes, when pictures were deleted from the
      list) and some minor problems.
    - added menu item "Scan Asynchronously" (corresponding
      tooltype is ASYNCSCANNING). the behavior of the background
      scanner is no longer dependent from the sortmode.
    - MysticView's multitasking is much nicer towards other
      applications now. all time-consuming jobs are running
      at the same priority. the default is 0 (if started from
      the workbench), or the same as of the shell process
      that launched MysticView. the PRIORITY setting has been
      removed. MysticView now works very comortable at high
      system load.
    - added GUI buttons for open, previous, next, slideshow,
      looping, etc. tooltype: SHOWBUTTONS. enabled by default. 
      you may also use a set of your own buttons via the
      BUTTONPIC tooltype. a tiny animation of MysticView's
      logo has been included, too. the respective tooltype
      is ANIMPIC.
    - MysticView now offers to change the filename for already
      existing pictures that are to be copied or moved.
    - copying, moving and deleting do no longer work
      asynchronously. MysticView now waits for these operations
      to complete.
    - added sort criteria filesize, filedate, combined
      path+filename, and a reverse-sort option.
    - the picture-info textline contains more useful
      information, and it updates while scanning and loading.
    - added self-starting feature, as known from many text
      editors. if another MysticView is running, the commandline
      option APPEND passes specified pictures/paths/patterns 
      to that instance. if no other MysticView is found, a new
      instance will be started.
    - shareware-nagging has been removed.
    - added menu item "Add Pictures..." to the current
      filelist.
    - added menu item "Add from List..." to the current
      filelist.
    - static-palette rendering gives better results
      (guigfx.library v15.2)
    - filerequester simplified: the default filename is now
      set to "#?", so committing "Okay" without selecting
      any files will include the entire directory's contents.
    - Added "First" function for skipping back to the
      first picture in a list. Skipping back stops a slideshow.
    - fixed a long-standing bug in mysticview.library that
      caused pictures to be rendered incompletely in slideshows.
    - the SLIDEDELAY tooltype setting is now measured in
      1:10th of seconds, no longer in seconds.
    - added PIP feature. (in this context it has nothing to
      do with graphics card hardware). it's experimental - 
      do not use it, it doesn't work very well together with
      opaque window sizing, thanks to these #?%&@! layer
      cliprects.
    - the neural network which tries to predict the user's
      desired displaymode has changed. it has got more brains
      now, and it differentiates more picture parameters,
      but it also requires more training. the network is now
      also recalled during window-resizing, thus MysticView
      may immediately switch the displaymode. this makes the AI
      feature a bit more transparent to the user, but also a
      bit more nasty. simply let the menu item 'Options/Learn'
      disabled if you think it's too confusing. recommended
      reading: configuration/AUTODISPLAYMODE
    - MysticView's commandline arguments are now sorted
      alphabetically. this might interfere with any particularly
      useful order, but at least you've got the chance to find
      something.
    - MysticView will never trash its window borders again, and
      this ugly window-border-refresh-maintenance-signalling-task
      is no longer needed and has been removed.
    - added SHOWARROW option. when enabled, MysticView draws
      small arrows at a picture's borders when it is not
      fully visible. enabled by default.
    - usability via keyboard has been improved. the space bar
      is now used for 'one-hand' control of slideshows, which
      is 'handy' for wanking over porn slides, for example. most
      important functions are now available on the numeric
      keypad.
    - changed qualifiers for scrolling via keyboard. CTRL scrolls
      by 100%, SHIFT by 10%, no qualifier scrolls by 1% per stroke.
    - "Reset Display Settings" now reacts instantly, not only
      when a new picture is getting displayed
    - MysticView now instantly reacts to changes of the sort mode
      and sorts the picture list while scanning/loading/viewing.
    - the option KEEPIMAGE (i.e. keep the current image while
      another one is being loaded) is obsolete and has been
      removed.
    - MysticView now correctly displays loading errors, and
      automatically retries loading after flushing the cache
      when the reason for failure was a lack of memory.
    - new default background color.
    - HAM artifacts have been reduced to an absolute minimum
      (mysticview.library v4).
    - added menu item "Remove". as the name suggests,
      this function simply removes a picture from a list
      (without deleting or moving)
    - added menu item "Save List as..." for saving the current
      list of pictures as a listfile.
    - lists are identified by a tooltype in their respective
      icon: "MYSTICVIEW_LISTFILE=YES". you can drag'n'drop
      listfiles to MysticView's window or appicon now.
    - workbench-integration has been improved even further:
      you can start MysticView by double-clicking
      preset and listfile icons, and even both at the same 
      time. (e.g. select a listfile, hold the shift key, and
      doublelick a presetfile - or the other way round.) you
      may also drag'n'drop listfile and preset icons on
      MysticView's window (or appicon) at the same time, or
      mix preset icons with pictures/directories/volumes.
    - the displaymodes "keep aspect max", "onepixel" and
      "fit to window" are no longer available in the menus.
      the remaining items have been renamed to
      "scale with aspect" and "display 1:1 pixel" (the last
      one corresponds to the IGNOREASPECT mode).
    - the option HIDEWITHPICTURE has been removed. MysticView
      no longer flushes the current (and buffered) pictures
      from memory when it gets iconified. scanning and
      preloading now silently continue in the background.
    - added an optional picture filter in filerequesters
      (tooltype: FILTERPICTURES). requested by hexaae.
    - requesting the previous picture stops a slideshow.
    - added DEFAULTTOOL setting
    - the REJECTPATTERN argument is now also used in
      filerequesters, not only applied to the picture scanner.
    - added tooltyoe items for a view's text and highlighting
      colors (TEXTCOLOR, MARKCOLOR)
    - added display refresh smoothing (SMOOTHDISPLAY). it will
      interpolate modifications on the display (only zooming
      and scrolling. rotating is not supported).
    - added tooltypes HIDEONCLOSE and HIDEONESCAPE.
    - the memory consumption for opaque-refreshing of
      truecolor pictures on non-truecolor screens has been
      reduced to only 25%, but its short-time peak memory
      consumption is even worse than before.
    - the picture cursor no longer trashes the window borders
      when a picture is rotated, nor does it overwrite
      the infotext. the picture cursor is no longer overwritten
      by the rendered picture - it's visible all the time now.
    - the cursor was placed incorrectly when the picture was
      rotated and zoomed. fixed.
    - some rare visual artifacts have been removed,
      such as background areas using a deallocated pen
    - with STARTPIC=none, MysticView did not always update its
      display correctly. fixed.
    - the former option PRELOAD is obsolete and has been removed.
      the loader is configured with the new setting BUFFERPERCENT.

                      
* 0.99f
    - newicon thumbnail creation did not work properly. fixed.
    - Thumbnail AutoUpdate now recognizes changes of the pictures
      themselves, as well as changes of the thumbnail parameters.
    - removed redundant modes from the screenmode requester.
    - some minor bugfixes.

  0.99e
    - the neural network has been overworked.
    - the AUTOSAVESETTINGS setting is no longer saved in the icon,
      it is now part of the global configuration
    - MysticView did not read its settings from an icon when it
      was started as an icon's default tool. fixed.
    - added AUTOCROP setting

  0.99d
    - added AUTODISPLAYMODE and a new menu entry "learn and predict".
      if activated, MysticView uses a small neural network to learn the
      user's desired displaymode for different kinds of pictures. "learn
      and predict" does not care about the rarely used displaymodes
      IGNOREASPECT and FIT. it will only learn from and try to predict
      KEEPASPECT, KEEPASPECT2, and ONEPIXEL.
    - added a new icon by M. Grothmann.

  0.99c
    - fixed display mode settings in the menus. mutual exclude
      was broken since 0.99b.
    - added menu item "rename to...". Renaming in this
      context means moving a picture to any place in the
      filing system. the difference towards "move picture"
      is that the picture is kept in the current picture
      list. requested by G. Hones.
    - MysticView's screen comes to front when a picture
      is dragged on the appicon. Requested by M. Grothmann.

  0.99b
    - the commandline arguments were broken as of v0.99. fixed.
    - "reset display settings" is now considered when the display
      mode is changed. requested by infinity.
    - re-enabled the escape key for quitting. requested by
      P. Habermehl and J. Urbanek
    - added PRIORITY setting (normal, nice, low). the priority
      is only considered when mysticview starts.
    - the options menu has been completely restructured.
      some settings have been removed from the menu, they are
      only accessible throughout tooltypes now: Hide mode,
      simple/smart refresh, keep image when hidden
    - removed every second frame of the supplied animation from
      the archive. it appeared somehow obscene to me to include
      half a megabyte of animation data for silly demonstration
      purposes
    - by default the system's screen font is used for the
      picture info text.
    - added FONTSPEC tooltype for the picture info text.
      syntax: size[,name]. example: FONTSPEC=8,topaz
    - revised the documentation. many details did not reflect
      recent changes.
    - with LMBACTION=NEXT, only mouseclicks that exactly hit the
      picture will actually advance the picture list.
    - slightly modified the supplied example presets.
      
* 0.99a
    - pictures moved to another directory are now removed from
      a list.
    - the package contained outdated versions of some libraries,
      and the installer did not update correclty. fixed.
    - the icons in the v0.99 archive still contained the old
      tooltype settings. fixed.

  0.99
    - added configurable left mousebutton action ('drag' or 'next')
    - a default preset path is no longer defined.
    - fixed a bug in the presetfile generation. 
    - fixed the startup. MysticView's icon settings were
      read and interpreted twice.

  0.98j
    - renamed NOLOOP to LOOP, NORECURSE to RECURSE, RENDERMEM to
      RENDERQUALITY.
    - all former boolean-type settings are now keyword settings.
      the keywords are "YES" and "NO".
    - removed the DEFICON tooltype.
    - SCROPENMODE "NONE" has been renamed to "DEFAULT".
    - restuctured the menus.
    - configurable paths and presets are now stored in env:/envarc:
      and saved automatically. this greatly enhances comfort and
      usability.
    - file management requesters are no longer opened on the default
      pubscreen, but rather on MysticView's screen.
    - Mysticview now uses the Workbench's SA_Pens when opening a
      new screen
    - added slideshow/no delay option.
    - added RESETDISPLAY setting. if enabled, the zoom/position/rotation
      settings are reset between pictures.
    - the installer no longer overwrites an already existing icon.
    - MysticView is no longer iconified when the close button is clicked
      or Escape is pressed. Iconify has to be invoked seperately.
    - changed some default settings.
    - added auto thumbnailing.
    - removed shareware limitation for thumbnail functions.
    - MysticView now creates icons for its preset files.
    - MysticView can now be started by doubleclicking a preset icon.
    - preset files can be dragged to MysticView's window.

  0.98i
    - fixed mouse movement problem that somtimes occured when MysticView's
      screen was left or re-activated. thanks to persistant nagging
      from Joker. this was a MysticView bug and NOT caused by MCP.
    - fixed asl file requester enforcer hit
    - the same picture is no longer preloaded in the background when
      only one picture is in the queue.
    - included some more semaphore protections to the background
      picture handler
    - fixed a rejectpattern bug/enforcer hit when no rejectpattern
      was specified
    - added menu item "Negative"
    - added some busy pointers
    - changed some hardcoded defaults and default settings in the
      distribution.
    - iconify mode default is now hardcoded to NO.
    - a picture is no longer reloaded when "keep image when hidden"
      is selected, slideshow mode is active, only one picture is
      in the queue, and MysticView gets uniconified. the same applies
      if the screen/windowmode is changed ("keep image when hidden"
      is not considered in this case)

  0.98h
    - you can now completely disable mysticview's logo by setting
      STARTPIC=none. mysticview now starts when a startpic wasn't
      found.
    - fixed a tiny memory leak in the settings that could occur with
      some options.
    - added THUMBSIZE and THUMBCOLORS.
    - improved subtask stability
    - added REJECTPATTERN
    - the startpic file requester could produce an enforcer hit. fixed.

* 0.98g
    - fixed slideshow bug: when only one picture was selected
      and slideshow plus loop mode was activated, the picture
      was reloaded over and over again. reported by Joker.
    - minor aspect problems fixed.
    - the image aspect is now displayed in the information
      textline.

  0.98f
    - added JPEG saving. (no options yet. default saving
      quality used).
    - fixed commandline options. reported by Kilyman.

  0.98e
    - added autodither.
    - fixed timing problems in slideshow mode.

  0.98d
    - MysticView now requires mysticview.library.

  0.98c
    - MysticView has been slightly sped-up on truecolor displays.
    - added ZOOMSTEP.
    - limited newicon thumbnails to a size of 80x80 pixels and
      64 colors. this will speed up the icon display on your
      Workbench. (this is still no final solution, though.)
    - added configurable slots for preset files. they can be
      accessed throughout CTRL F1 ... F10 and configured
      by selecting them from the menu. requested by H. Richter.
    - the same scheme now applies to the configurable destination
      paths for copying/moving. keyboard executes, menu selection
      configures.
    - slideshows didn't always stop immediately. fixed.
    - the REQUESTFILE option is now considered after a slideshow
      stopped. requested by P. Habermehl.
    - implemented SHOWCURSOR.
    - finally fixed the publicscreen/customscreen problem. the
      setting SCROPENMODE=CUSTOM/PUBLIC/NONE replaces the former
      tooltype CUSTOMSCREEN.
    - added CX_PRIORITY, CX_POPKEY and CX_POPUP.
      MysticView is now a commodity. ESC to hide, Amiga-Q to quit.
      note: 'hide' keeps the current image - and you keep that in
      mind when you iconify MysticView with a 2880x1440x24 image :)
    - the screen is no longer closed and reopened for the change of
      window settings.
    - fixed a memory allocation bug with the PUBSCREEN setting.
    - many minor changes
    - added AUTOHIDE.
    - the picture aspect is now handled for thumbnails.
    - added pubscreen select and default/public/custom menu items.
    - added appicon
    - added rotation. (preliminary. SHOWCURSOR and grid refresh doesn't
      work corretly with the image being rotated) 
    - fixed install script for 030/FPU version. Reported by B. Murray.
    - deleted pictures are now removed from the list and MysticView
      advances to the next picture. requested by P. Dahlberg.
    - added ROTATESTEP
    - added DEFICON
    - added CONFIRM. requested by P. Dahlberg.
    - added HIDEWITHPICTURE.
    - added ICONIFY.

  0.98b
    - fixed PUBSCREEN setting. pubscreens have got precedence
      over CUSTOMSCREEN now. reported by P. Habermehl and M.
      Kilimann.
    - fixed MysticView's new icon to use only required colors.
      reported by M. Kilimann.
    - looping and AUTOQUIT are now applied in general,
      not only in slideshow mode. requested by P. Habermehl.

* 0.98a
    - forgot to implement NORECURSE tooltype setting. fixed.
    - added NOLOOP and AUTOQUIT settings. requested by P. Habermehl.
    - most important recent change: new default background color :)
    - implemented SORTMODE none/random/alpha
    - added limitations for unregistered users. :)

  0.97h
    - added DITHERMODE setting. implemented EDD dithering.
    - renamed DITHER to DITHERING.
    - pictures that could not be loaded no longer interrupt
      slideshows, and a proper error message will be displayed.
    - added Delete Picture.
    - copy/move/delete now applies to the pictures' icons, too.
    - added STARTPIC setting.
    - restructured menus.
    - added Flip Horizontally and Flip Vertically.
    - MysticView now creates an icon for its settings, if necessary.
    - implemented loading and saving of presets, added PRESETPATH
      and PRESETFILE settings
    - fixed DEFAULT option. now the defaults are overridden by
      arguments specified in the command line.

  0.97g
    - the preload task's priority has been reset to -1.
    - added newicon thumbnail feature. (preliminary,
      for experimental purposes only)

* 0.97f
    - added preloading.
    - added invisible close and screenback gadgets. this works
      only when both the settings WINSIZEMODE=FULL and
      BACKDROP are specified.
    - MysticView no longer forgets the current filename when
      the configuration is changed, and slideshows will be
      continued.
    - added some more keyboard shortcuts
    - dropped the german documentation, created a guide file and
      an install script

  0.97e
    - added picture information and PICINFO setting
    - implemented a new picture-management class consisting
      of several subtasks.
    - slideshow now works as expected. (preload is not
      yet re-implemented, though)
    - fixed many menu-related problems and improved menu layout
    - added copy to..., move to... for 10 configurable slots each.
    - all path/filenames are now handled dynamically
    - with the REQUESTFILE option enabled, a requester no
      longer pops up when images were specified at startup.
    - improved memory management
    - when initialization fails, a requester is shown for
      retry, cancel, or retry using defaults.
    - added LISTFILE commandline option. it allows to specify a
      list file from where to fetch pictures.
    - added Open List File... menu and LISTPATH config.
    - the window border is now refreshed correctly (after approx.
      1/5 second. guess what, a subtask is used here. opaque window
      sizing would suffer too much from refreshing the window border
      all the time :)
    - finally! MysticView should close down gently now if the required
      versions of guigfx or render.library could not be opened (#&§@%!?)
    - new icon tooltypes are created dynamically. no need to upgrade
      MysticView's icon anymore.

  0.97d
    - the configuration is now saved to MysticView's icon.
    - menu items didn't toggle correctly (forgot MENUTOGGLE.
      what the heck, why does this work with MagicMenu ;)
    - added more CTRL_C exit breakpoints

    - added AUTOSAVESETTINGS
    - added PREVIEWMODE 
    - added grid refresh
    - fixed lots of minor quirks and problems

  0.97c
    - slightly improved screenmode selection logic:
      default screen size is now the workbench's visual
      dimensions, no longer its absolute size.
    - re-implemented screenaspect tooltypes (thanks to ZZA :)
    - added slideshow mode
    - MysticViw now reads its configuration from the icon,
      even when started from shell. commandline arguments
      simply override the settings from the icon's tooltypes.
    - added mouse scrolling - it's now possible to drag the
      picture around in MysticView's window.
    - added a lot of menu items
    - improved HAM refresh logic
    - the screen's title bar is no longer obscured in
      WINOPENMODE=VISIBLE and without BACKDROP mode.
    - added MODEID, SCRWIDTH, SCRHEIGHT
    - added screenmode requester

  0.97b
    - MysticView crashed without cybergraphics. Fixed.

  0.97a
    - The display part has been rewritten. Now a daemon-like
      view-class handles the display as a background task.
      the new display logic is faster.
    - implemented zooming and scrolling in all displaymodes
      (except for DISPLAYMODE=FIT).
    - implemented DISPLAYMODE KEEPASPECT2 and IGNOREASPECT.
      DISPLAYMODE=ONEPIXEL has got a slightly different meaning now.
    - implemented asychronous, recursive directory scanning.
    - multiselect und patternmatching is now supported via
      drag&drop, filerequester, commandline and wbstart.
