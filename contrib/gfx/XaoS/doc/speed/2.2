Thank you for using XaoS

This means:
Aprox number of calculated pixels for every frame:203 (0.31%) was 220
16% of calculated pixels lies inside set
Aprox number of new lines/columns for every frame:2.31 (was 2.37)
Optimizations:
Aproximation :  99.54% of calculations (was 99.49%)
Symetry saved:  02.32% of remaining    (was 02.76%)
Solid guessing: 56.91% of remaining    (was 60.80%)
mirroring2:     0%     (no efective from mset. Slows down when active. Will be disabled)

result: Optimizations seems to work a bit better at all. (solid guessing came lower..
but this result is bit random. Sometimes I have for example 80%) Aproximation works
better.

This means:
Aprox number of calculated pixels for every frame:1503 was 3364
10% of calculated pixels lies inside set
Aprox number of new lines/columns for every frame:234 (caused by resolution lowering)
Optimizations:
Aproximation :  unknown-resolution lowering of  (was 99.49%)
