Hi,

I am poor Czech student, and I need some money to upgarde
my computer (I have one in Tabor and other in Prague). One in Tabor
is just 486/66, wich is quite slow today. Currently I received some
money, wich helped me to buy computer to Prague, upgarde my HDD and 
buy hercules (and XaoS now supports text mode:).  Thank you very much.
This donations helps me to do more work at free software and avoid 
some boring commercial jobs. 

I received money from someone in Brasil, but I was unable to contact him 
trought email, since email he noted in letter didn't worked. I am sorry for 
that.

If you wish help me or to XaoS development, please send some money to

Jan Hubicka
Dukeskych bojovniku 1944
Tabor 390 03
Czech Republic

Note that I am not author of whole XaoS, but I've done most of main routines.
Author of other parts are listed at the beggining of README files. You
might send money to them, if you wish.

We also created an Czech Free Software Foundation, wich wants to support
development of free software in Czech Republic. Current projects are:
* Czech Linux Users group
* Domain .gnu.cz
* Free Software for blind users
* Linux for Czech Users
* Linux news
and others. If you wish to get more information about this organization,
browse its homepage at http://www.freesoft.cz. Informations for
sponzors are at http://www.freesoft.cz/english/sponzor.txt

This program is part of GNU project. If you want to help GNU project, as
a whole, you might sponzor an FSF (Free Software Foundation). Please
see GNU homepage at http://www.gnu.org.
