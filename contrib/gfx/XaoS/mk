#this ic compilling script for plan9...
#my demo installation of plan9 don't have
#files required to write real mkfiles
#(I already received one mkfile for XaoS, but I can't use it, since
#include files is missing. I decided to remove it, since it became
#really obsolette after new directory structure was introduced.
#
#(still hope that once I will have full version of plan9)
