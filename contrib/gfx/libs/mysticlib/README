Short:    RTG image viewing library
Author:   Timm S. Müller <tmueller@neoscientists.org>
Type:     dev/misc
Version:  5.0
Requires: os3.x (v39), 68030/68881, guigfx.library, render.library


  mysticview.library is the third abstraction layer in top of
  guigfx.library and render.library.
  
  mysticview.library implements an RTG image display class. it
  renders images of any kind to a RastPort on any screenmode.

  there are no considerations on the programmer's side
  required for issues such as screenmodes, aspect ratios,
  scaling, OCS/ECS/AGA, HAM, chunky/planar, 8bit, 1bit, 24bit
  or alike. all you have to do is to specify a Screen, a
  RastPort, a guigfx.library 'picture' and some attributes.
  images will be rendered, scaled and dithered automatically,
  when needed.

  rendering and layouting takes place in the background. you
  create the object, and forget it. the background task
  instantly reacts to changes of attributes and will redraw
  the display when needed. opaque scaling and SIMPLE_REFRESH
  is easily implemented, you only need to supply new
  attributes. a protection mechanism is implemented for
  sharing the RastPort between your application and the
  background task of mysticview.library.

  this library makes it REALLY EASY to display any kind of
  pictures inside any kind of application. the basic
  implementation looks like this:
  
  APTR picture, mview;
  
  picture = LoadPicture("filename", TAG_DONE);

  mview = MV_Create(screen, rastport, MVIEW_Picture, picture,
     TAG_DONE);

  if (mview)
  {
    MV_DrawOn(mview);
    while(...) { /* image visible */ }
  }
  
  MV_Delete(mview);
  DeletePicture(picture);  

  mysticview.library is the fully encapsulated display engine
  of the image viewer 'MysticView'. you are free to use this
  library in freeware and shareware applications.
