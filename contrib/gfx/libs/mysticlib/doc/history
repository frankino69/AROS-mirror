history

  5.0

    - version number bumped, now requesting guigfx.library v19


  4.3

	- minor code cleanups
	
	- library source code added to the distribution.

	- MorphOS version included. thanks to Sigbjørn Skjæret
	  for porting.

	- example source added to the distribution.
	

  4.2
  
    - added MVIEW_Priority tag. only available in MV_Create().
  
    - MV_DrawOn() can fail, and it returns BOOL now. this
      is an intermediate solution. this should be finally handled
      with all the required initalizations performed inside
      MV_Create(), so that MV_Draw() may always return TRUE in
      the future.
  
    - MVIEW_Rotation was not returned by MV_GetAttrs(). fixed.


  4.1
    - many optimizations

    - supports guigfx.library v16 rastport locking.
    
    - fixed several minor bugs in the autodither logic.
      finally it should work as expected under all
      circumstances


  4.0
    - a mysticview's task priority is no longer fixed
      to 0, but derived from the calling task.

    - semaphore protection leak fixed when setting
      the attribute MVIEW_Text

    - fixed a parent-task signalling bug.
      when rendering was aborted, a finishing signal was
      submitted anyway.

    - the picture cursor is no longer written into
      the window border

    - removed some rare visual artifacts, such as background
      areas shortly using an unallocated pen
      
    - many internal paths have been optimized, especially
      for drawing text and background. setting the attribute
      MVIEW_Text is now handled more efficiently
    
    - added MVIEW_DrawArrow attribute.
    - added MVIEW_ShowPiP attribute.

    - the cursor was placed incorrectly in rotated state. fixed.

  3.1
    - new attributes are smarter interpreted. redrawing
      can be avoided sometimes.

  3.0
    - rotation is no longer considered in MVDISPMODE_FIT. this
      combination resulted in total nonsense.
    - added attributes MVIEW_PictureX, _PictureY, _PictureWidth
      and _PictureHeight.

  2.0

    - the background is no longer cleared when certain picture settings
      are modified.

  1.3
    - the background is no longer cleared between different pictures 
      in truecolor or staticpalette mode. requested by infinity.

  1.2
    - added MVIEW_ReadySignal. Supply this signal to be signalled when
      an image becomes fully visible in highest quality.
   
  1.1
    - added MVIEW_AUTODITHER.

  1.0
    - initial release
