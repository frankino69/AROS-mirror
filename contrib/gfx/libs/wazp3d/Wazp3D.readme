DESCRIPTION 
Wazp3D beta 37 : Alain THELLIER - Paris - FRANCE - (November 2006 to April 2008) 
Wazp3D is a library intended to be compatible with the famous Warp3D.library for AmigaOS 68040 

LICENSE 
GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) 

MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES 
o Compatible with the famous Warp3D.library for AmigaOS 68040 
o The 88 functions from the latest Warp3D.library v4.2 are presents :-) 
o Sources included (...so Wazp3D has been ported to AROS) 
o Software only (=slow) : no need to have 3D hardware 
o Work in UAE so can serve to test your 3D softwares inside UAE 
o The Wazp3D driver can lie and pretend to be a "perfect hardware driver"  so the 3D-softwares will not fail due to a lacking feature. 
o Full Documentation, faq and grabs at http://thellier.free.fr/Wazp3D.htm 
o Unlike QuarkTex you can run multiple Warp3D applications concurrently 
o Built-in debugger

INSTALLATION 
copy LIBS:Warp3D.library TO LIBS:Warp3D.library.sav 
copy Wazp3D.library TO LIBS:Warp3D.library 

HISTORY 
Wazp3D was first created to test the "Tales of Tamar"'s 3D Map inside WinUAE. 
I have no time left to work more on this Wazp3D project. So i release the source & library 

VERSIONS  HISTORY 
Beta 37 
Changes since previous one: 
o Four new games are working now: Alybox, D3gnop, Sopoblock,YAPMG :-) 
o New option "Reload Textures" to load a new texture set (to change ugly originals textures) 
o Library also builded without debugger (smaller version) 
o New option "Hack ARGB" to convert  directly ARGB textures data to RGBA (for Tamar 3D) = economize memory 
o Obsolete option "Clamp UV[0.0 1.0]" is removed (textures are allways W3D_REPEAT) 

Beta 36 
Changes since previous one: 
o Nicer & a few faster with some new optimised pixels functions 
o Texture-repeat works (Bzone) 
o Smooth Textures options 
o More compatible : Fog or coloring works now on partially transparent faces (like trees in Tamar 3D) = new pixels functions 
o Fog works better (not perfect yet) 
o New options "Use ClearImage" & "Update At UnlockHardware "  to enhance update for some programs like gears(screen),Engine, sKulpt or TheVague. 

Beta 35 
Changes since previous one: 
o Code clean-up and library enhancements from Gunther Nikl 
o "Hack1 tex RGBA" works again (draw a textured-triangle as a Gouraud untextured one = faster) 
o "Hack2 tex RGBA" works again (draw a textured-triangle as a   Flat  untextured one = faster) 

Beta 34 
Changes since previous one: 
o Brand new pixels functions that allow to render lighted textures :-) so looks now very nice 
o Corrected a very bad bug  concerning pixels-buffering. 
o New Bug has appeared :-/ so 4D-clock & other StormMesa stuffs now crash... 
o Library is smaller :-) 

Beta 33 
Changes since previous one: 
o Full Documentation at http://thellier.free.fr/Wazp3D.htm 
o Corrected a very bad bug introduced in beta 32 concerning memory freeing (beta 32 line 644) 
o Corrected a very bad bug in W3D_UpdateTexSubImage 
o AROS port from Matthias Rustler 
o Various pointer==NULL bugs corrected by Matthias Rustler 
o ClampUV (if disabled allow texture_repeat) 
o Perspective correction (disabling) 
o Zbuffer enhanced = ReadZSpan/WriteZSpan/etc... 
o Code CleanUp (no more ULONG used as pointers to texture) 
o Bug fix in GetDriverTexFmtInfo : now if use UseAnyTexFmt is ON then return supported 
o More compatible with new 3Dprogs (BattleZone,Lamintro,4D-Clock,StormMesa examples, etc) 
o Support rectangular textures 
o Bug fix in Alpha blending on 32 bits texture but no zbuffer 

Beta 32 
Changes since previous one: 
o No more warnings when recompiling 
o Perspective correction (cant be disabled) 
o 3D-Clipper works 
o Less bugs (even some few fatals one) 
o Fog works (not perfect) 
o First Culling (CCW/CW face order) implementation (still bugged) 
o "Hack1 tex RGBA" works (draw a textured-triangle as a Gouraud untextured one = faster) 
o "Hack2 tex RGBA" works (draw a textured-triangle as a   Flat  untextured one = faster) 
o "AntiAlias Screen" new & works (3x3 median per pixel) (slow) 
o Library is smaller :-) 
o More compatible with new 3Dprogs 

Beta 31 (first public one) 
Changes since previous one: 
o New tracked memory allocation 
o Project's name changed to "Wazp3D" 

KNOWN BUGS 
o SOFT3D_ClearImage (= clearing Wazp3D internal RGBA buffer) dont use well the MinUpdate region (This bug is patched) 
o Refresh display problem (sKulpt) 
o StormMesa  crashs 
o Fog still not perfect 

TO DO IN THE FUTURE 
o Option to dump rendered objects as text-files 
o A faster coloring... 
o Make StormMesa progs working.... 
o Builtin FPS counter 
o A GPL demo program 

IMPORTANT 
Wazp3D is not perfect but it was good enough for me :-) 
This Wazp3D binary is intended to be used within a very fast 68040 AmigaOS (= UAE emulator with JIT like WinUAE) 
This Wazp3D binary is compiled for 68040-68881 (adjust your WinUAE settings) 
Also need "full screen RTG" & JIT both to be activated to obtain enough speed 
(also need picasso 96/cybergraphics and an RGB24 screen) 
Wazp3D is NOT an UAE hack and so (should) not depend on a particular UAE version 
But it only need much speed for his software rendering 
Some 3Dprogs need a big stack to be able to run without crash (glsokoban,etc...)
