guigfx environment variables
----------------------------

  guigfx/USESCALEPIXELARRAY
  internal default: 0

    use ScalePixelArray() / cybergraphics v41

    if you have cybergraphics v41 (or later) installed to
    your system, this flag tells guigfx.library to use
    ScalePixelArray() for scaling truecolor data to truecolor
    displays.
    
    ScalePixelArray() scales inside the graphics card's memory
    and can thereof be very fast. it is NOT used by default,
    due to accuracy problems. ScalePixelArray()
    
    - uses an incorrect bresenham algorithm
    - overwrites areas outside the specified rectangle
    - overwrites areas outside the specified rastport
    - flickers

    set this flag to 1 if you prefer higher performance
    instead of higher accuracy.
  
    
  guigfx/USEWPA8
  internal default: 0

    use WritePixelArray() on native Amiga screenmodes

    the OS functions WriteChunkyPixels(), WritePixelArray8() and
    WritePixelLine8() are awfully slow and almost unusable on
    native Amiga displays. therefore, guigfx.library uses an
    internal chunky-2-planar conversion for planar displays.

    there are very fast third-party patches available to
    improve the performance of WritePixelArray(). if you
    are using such a patch for WritePixelArray(), set this
    flag to 1.
    
    note: this flag is meaningless for graphics card displays.

  
  guigfx/AUTODITHERTHRESHOLD
  internal default: 250

    set global default autodither threshold
  
    this setting allows you to set a global default for
    guigfx.library's autodither feature. the lower, the earlier
    dithering is activated.

    note: applications may override this global default value.
