Short:    application layer for pixel graphics
Author:   Timm S. Müller <tmueller@neoscientists.org>
Type:     dev/misc
Version:  20.0
Requires: os3.x (v39), render.library


overview
-----------------------------

  - guigfx.library is an application layer for pixel graphics.

  - guigfx.library breaks the chains of all those nasty
    planar, chunky, 8/16/24bit, OS3.0, OS3.1, OCS, ECS, AGA,
    CybergraphX and Picasso96 considerations.

  - with guigfx.library you no longer have to take care about your
    application running on a OCS machine or on a high-end
    graphics-card system.

  - guigfx.library lets you freely choose truecolor graphics for
    your applications.

  - with guigfx.library your graphics will always look as fine as
    possible, on any screen, no matter if driven on 24 bit
    1024x768 CybergraphX/Picasso96, on HAM8, or 1 bit productivity
    interlaced.

  - guigfx.library does quick color-reduction, rendering,
    remapping and dithering for you. only you don't know when,
    on which machine, under what circumstances.

  - guigfx.library treats scaling as a standard operation.
    it is available at any time, without extra consideration,
    without extra memory consumption, even without a true loss
    of performance.
    
  - guigfx.library handles screen pen allocation in an extremely
    effective way.

  - guigfx.library hides bugs, incompatibilities and insufficiencies
    of graphics.library, cybergraphics.library and Picasso96 from
    you. it is an attempt to render incompatibilities between
    different versions of CybergraphX and Picasso96 obsolete.
    
  - guigfx.library features picture.datatype import. standard and
    v43 (including Picasso96) picture datatypes are automatically
    recognized and used as available.

  - guigfx.library does not call SetFunction() and is hereby
    guaranteed to never do so in future versions.

  - guigfx.library puts all that stuff into a black-box,
    freeing your mind for the creative part.

recent changes
-----------------------------

v20.0
	- added picture attributes PICATTR_NumPaletteEntries and
	  PICATTR_Palette to GetPictureAttrs(). This way you can
	  query a picture's palette. PICATTR_NumPaletteEntries will
	  currently always return 256 if a picture is palette-based,
	  and zero otherwise. PICATTR_Palette expects a buffer of
	  256 ULONG entries in (by default) the format PALFMT_RGB8.
	  Requested by Andreas Falkenhahn.
	  
v19.2
    - when a picture was read from a hicolor/truecolor rastport
      using ReadPicture(), a palette was incorporated to the picture.
      ClonePicture() created a copy of that palette but did not
      actually place it in the resulting picture. when the library
      was closed, the leak was indicated with a ILLEGAL exception.
      fixed.

v19.1
	- fixed a LOOONG standing bug when adding pictures to
	  a pensharemap, when the picture was less than 7 lines
	  high. ouch!
