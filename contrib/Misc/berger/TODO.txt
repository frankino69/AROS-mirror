- All instructions that modify the condiction codes should be replaced by
  inlince assembly code for the specific target processor.

- the instruction code word should not be passed to the Group functions
  but written into the M68k structure. This should speed it up.

- the register field and mode field should not be passed to the addressing
  function but rather taken from th eM68k structure where the current 
  instruction word can be found.
