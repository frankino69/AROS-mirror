ToDo:
 - Make Freecell statistics compatible to Klondike.
 - Better statistics handling after game joining.
 - Auto select cardsets option (random, saved in profiles file).
   - After every x (option) games or
   - After every x (option) program start
 - last stats place is always replaced even if it was better than
   new one?
 - Add somewhat nicer default cardset handling (images for numbers and
   signs internally)
 - get updated locale files and docs
 - move date generation to makefile (used in Main.c)
 - fix cases, where saved settings are ignored on loading (gamemode -->
   display gamemode with checkmark menu)
   -> GameMode is not saved
   -> Settings object is not yet informed about mode change
   -> On loading no gamemode is selected
 - Add Freecell move button support
