WHAT'S CHANGED FROM 2.00 to 2.1

 * Now it is GPL and thus freely distributable and usable.
 * Development done using Soliton project at http://www.sourceforge.net/
 * Implemented much more localisation stuff.
 * Changed highscore and profile data formats.
 * Migrated code from C++ to plain C code and shortened
   the resulting files.
 * Removed obsoleted code parts.
 * Joined Freecell and Klondike code to use one unique code
   base. This also results in better statistics and more functions
   for Freecell variant.
 * Joined both Soliton games completely.
 * Now detects REKO-cardsets automatically (by size) and needs no
   longer the SOLITON keyword for reko.datatype.
 * Fixed crash when double clicking on klondike stack card before
   clicking new button.
 * When XAD system is installed, the cardsets maybe archived in
   any supported archive type (if there are multiple files in the
   archive, the largest one is taken).

   Soliton Klondike and Soliton Freecell.

   profile settings.

   included to the distribution to fit to all screenmodes.
 * Updated install script (Better icon positioning, ...)
 * Improved pile positioning when changing window size.
 * Updated documentation, seperated Copyright section.
 * Removed all translations, they all need to be updated
   more or less. Note: a new polish translation is already
   been worked on by Mariusz Danilewicz.
 * Reko2Soliton.ifx updated (Thanks to Cary Driscoll)

WHAT'S CHANGED FROM 1.70 to 1.71 (1999-01-30)
 * Fixed background pattern bug.
 * Increased number of profiles to 20. (If you have so many
   Soliton cardsets, why don't you upload some of them to
   Aminet? ;-) The old configuration file cannot be read
   anymore, sorry.
 * Builtin pseudo-cardset for situations when no cardset
   can be loaded. It is ugly, you should never see it.
 * Fixed a score cheating bug.

WHAT'S CHANGED FROM BETA 1.61 to 1.70 (1998-04-13)
 * All <n> cards are displayed when playing "open <n> cards".
 * Re-enabled 'block moves' option.

 * I hope that beta-testing is finally over with this
   version!? I think that everyhing is ok now, but...

WHAT'S CHANGED FROM BETA 1.60 to BETA 1.61 (1998-03-28)
 * External MCC_Cardgame class. It may become public in
   future. Mail me if you think you could use it!
 * Probably fixed problems with cards not getting cleared
   in V1.60 beta. Maybe even fixed the strange old flying
   cards bug???

WHAT'S CHANGED FROM 1.51 to BETA 1.60 (1998-03-21)
 * Rewrote playfield class completely:

   - different layout mechanism
   - maybe some more bugs because everything is new?
   - maybe some bugs fixed because everything is new?
   - the options 'Opaque cards', 'Beep', 'Auto open topleft'
     and 'Block moves' did not survive. Opaque cards is
     now on by default, the other ones are off. Mail me
     if you miss one of them.
 * Polish catalog
 * Cool-buttons hide their images of small screens,
   so their is no need for standard buttons anymore.
 * Lost games counter and timer start not before you
   touch a card.

 * Rewrote drag'n'drop mechanism. Now there is smooth card
   movement at the end of a drag'n'drop and smooth (flying)
   drag abort.

   on small screens.
