I`ve tried to write a sample source code of all new OS 2.xx gadget types.

The code opens a window which contains all thoses gadgets and handles
them. I hope the code is easy understandable.


I`m using thew Manx 5.2a Compiler and I think there should be no problems to
compile it under other systems too. You can easily compile this code with
`cc <Name>` and link it with `lc <name.o> -lc`.

I think there are some programmers, which might have some problems to
create the new gadget types and their handling. Or to write a correct
gadtools-user-interface.

I hope this little example will help someone and I`m looking forward for
a lot of wonderful programs.

Done
