                 Split,Join&Recover for UNIX, PC & Amiga. 

Description:
============
  This tool is for splitting up large files and rejoining them later, to
  facilitate transportation of large files on floppy disks.

  It also offers error recovery, so a faulty disk no longer means lost data.


Functions:
==========
  - Split a large file into a several smaller files.

  - Join a set of smaller files to one large file. (like cat, join etc.)

  - Recreate a lost file by using the other files, and an extra file of
    error recovery information.

===========
  - Type "sploiner example" for a detailed example of how to use sploiner. 

    This is probably the fastest way to find out what sploiner can, and 
    how to use it.
