Subject: Batch Unbinhexing/Unstuffing (SUMMARY and SOURCE)


Quite a while ago, I requested info on batch un-binhexing/
un-stufing software available for the mac. I received a few
replies about this, all of them but one suggesting a solution
centered around a mainframe. One person suggested that Ray Lau's 
commercial version of Stuffit might do batch work.

What I found was a trio of programs from the archives at
sumex-aim.stanford.edu in the /info-mac/unix directory. The
combination of these three programs allow almost-batch operation
(I'll get into why it's 'almost' later).

The three programs are:
-rw-r--r--  1 macmod   info-mac    54554 Jan 16 18:18 mcvert-15.shar

    mcvert converts a .hqx (BinHex 4.0) file to a .bin (MacBinary
    file) that can be read by unsit. This program allows wildcard
    operations. Additionally, mcvert will unpack PackIt files.

    Files in: *.hqx
    Files out: *.bin (generally *.sit.bin)

-rw-r--r--  1 macmod   info-mac    26067 Jan  1  1989 unsit.shar

    unsit will decompress .sit.bin (MacBinary Stuffit files)

    I am enclosing a new version of unsit that Allen sent me to
    allow input from MacBinary files. Previously, it was only
    possible to input from macput/macget formatted files. The new version
    also adds compatiblity with Stuffit 1.5.1 and the new HMF
    folder scheme.

    At present, unsit can only output files in macput/macget format,
    but the author Allan Weber (weber%brand.usc.edu@oberon.usc.edu)
    said that he may add the option to output directly to MacBinary format.

    Files in: *.sit.bin 
    Files out: foo.rsrc, foo.data, foo.info 
                       
-rw-r--r--  1 macmod   info-mac     4184 Jan  1  1989 macbinary.shar

    macbinary (macbin) converts macput/macget type files to
    MacBinary files. This allows easy downloading with progams
    such as Kermit or ZTerm.

    macbin does NOT support wildcards, so this part of the
    conversion must be done manually.

    Files in: foo.rsrc, foo.data, foo.info
    Files out: foo.bin (Unstuffed and in Binary format)


The combination of programs works very well and is extremely fast
on our vax, especially when comparied to Stuffit's performance on
a Plus.

Since this process requires the use of three different programs,
I'm writing a shell script to tie everything together. When I get
it running, I'll send it along too.

I'm including a new version of unsit that reads macbinary files.

The problem is probably that unsit is expecting the file to be just the
data fork of the Mac file, and Macbinary format has the data and resource
forks together along with a header.  I've include the lastest version of
unsit below in case you don't have it.  Some time ago I added a option to
the program to make it skip the Macbinary header by using a "-m" switch
on the command line.  Try the version below with the -m and hopefully it
will work.

			  Unsit, version 1.5

These are the souces for "unsit", a Unix program for breaking apart
StuffIt archive files created on a Macintosh into separate files on
the Unix system.  See the documentation at the beginning of "unsit.c"
or the man page "unsit.1" for more information.

To build the program, compile unsit.c and updcrc.c and link together.
If your system doesn't have the getopt() routine in its standard
library, also compile getopt.c and include it in the link.

This program opens a pipe to the "compress" program for doing the
uncompression of some of the files in the archive.  Most Unix sites
probably already have "compress".  If not, it can be found in the
comp.sources.unix archives.

Comments and bug reports should be send to weber%brand.usc.edu@oberon.usc.edu
