NAME
     unsit - extract/list files in a Macintosh Stuffit archive
     file

SYNOPSIS
     unsit [ -dflmqruv ] file

DESCRIPTION
     For the Stuffit archive file listed, unsit extracts the
     files in the archive into separate files.  This makes it
     possible, for example, to separate a large StuffIt file into
     component files for selective downloading, rather than down-
     loading the larger archive file just to extract a single,
     small file.  It also allows the use of StuffIt to compress a
     group of files into a single, smaller archive that can be
     uploaded to a Unix system for storage, printing, etc.

     In the normal mode, both the data and the resource forks of
     the component Macintosh files in the archive are extracted
     and stored in Unix files with the extension .data and .rsrc
     appended to the end of the Macintosh file name.  In addi-
     tion, a .info file will be created with the Finder informa-
     tion.  These three file are compatible with the macput pro-
     gram for downloading to a Mac running Macterminal.  If only
     the data or resource fork is extracted, no addition exten-
     sion is appended to the Mac file name.  Characters in the
     Mac file name that are illegal (or unwieldy, like spaces)
     are changed to underscores in the Unix file name.  The true
     Mac file name is retained in the .info file and is restored
     when the file is downloaded.

     StuffIt version 1.5 has the ability to archive a group of
     files and folders in such a way that the hierarchical rela-
     tionship of the files and folders is maintained.  Unsit ver-
     sion 1.5 can unpack files archived in this manner and place
     them in corresponding subdirectories so as to maintain the
     hierarchy.  As an option, the hierarcy can be flattened out
     and all the files stored in the current directory.

     The options are similar to those for macput and unpit.

     -f   For StuffIt files containing a "Hierarchy Maintained
          Folder" entry, extract the files into a "flat" organi-
          zation (all in the current directory) rather than main-
          taining the hierarchy by creating new directories, etc.
          Default is to maintain the hierarchical folder organi-
          zation.

     -l   List the files in the archive but do not extract them.
          The name, size, type, and creator of each file is
          listed.

     -m   Assumes the input file in MacBinary format rather than
          macput/macget format and skips over the MacBinary
          header.

     -r   Extract resources forks only.

     -d   Extract data forks only.

     -u   Extract data fork and change into a Unix text file.
          This only works if the file is really a text file.

     -q   Query user before extracting files and folders.  If a
          "n" answer is given for a folder, none of the files or
          folders in that folder will be extracted.

     -v   Verbose option.  Causes unsit to list name, size, type,
          and creator of each file extracted.

BUGS
     Files that were compressed by StuffIt with the Lempel-Ziv
     method and are extracted with the -u switch (text files) are
     not checked for a correct CRC value when unsit uncompresses
     them.  This is because unsit pipes the data through compress
     and tr to extract the file and never has a chance to do the
     CRC check.

     The compress program has been observed to go into strange
     states when uncompressing a damaged file.  Often it will get
     stuck writing out bogus data until the disk fills up.  Since
     unsit sends data through compress, the same problem could
     occur when extracting files from a damaged Stuffit archive.

FILES
     For archives that have been compressed with the Lempel-Ziv
     method, the compress program must be present on the system
     and in the search path since unsit uses it for the
     uncompressing.  Compress is available from the
     comp.sources.unix archives.
