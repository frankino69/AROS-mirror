This is an Amiga port of Allan G. Weber's Unsit v1.5c for Unix.

It supports RLE, Huffman, & LZW compression.  It doesn't support the
proprietary compression modes of Stuffit Deluxe.

I recommend you use the accompanying version of "compress" (v5.3) with Unsit
(external program used for LZW uncompression).  Use other versions of
"compress" at your own risk.

Source and docs included.  Amiga executables removed from Unix distribution.

                                                           -- Anthon

Addendum - 1991 September 8 - Anthon Pang (apang@mindlink.bc.ca)

This fixes a small bug, whereby decompression of lzw compressed files failed
if the filename contained spaces.  (Code was correct in Unix version.)

New feature (internal)...popen/pclose emulation code (ie using more of the
original code in the Amiga version).  (Source for pio.h & pio.c available
elsewhere.)

Included "compress.man", a formatted man page for "compress".  Please note
that it has some small differences (in wording) from "compress.1" (which is
unformatted).  At least it's readable...
