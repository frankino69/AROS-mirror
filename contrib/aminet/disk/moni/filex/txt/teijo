Hi Teijo!

Do you know who's writing here? I received a letter from you with some
suggestions, bug reports and the Finnish catalog file to my binary editor
FileX three months ago. I thought that the new version of FileX would be
out shortly after I've got your letter. But I was wrong. Programing takes
always at least double the time you think before :-)

However, now the new version 2.0 is ready to be released. I think that I've
implemented all of your suggestions(the bugs are killed, the compound words
aren't compound words any more, there's a key file system, ...).

You've send me the Finnish catalog file for version 1.1. Would you
also like to translate the catalog for version 2.0? That's because
I contact you 2-3 weeks before the official release. On the disk
you can find the latest beta version, your key file and a blank
catalog translation file. Till now there's only a German documentation.

If you have got the time to translate the catalog just do it. 
Try to email me the translation. If you haven't got access to
the usenet try "Klaas Hermanns @ 2:2440/98", but I've never tested
this fido address. If email fails, send it on a disk:-(

But now to your letter. I want to quote some lines:

Of course, I heard of MED. Some years ago, I think it was 1989, me and
a friend of mine wrote an intro. This was one of my first programing
experiences. Of course we needed good music. He composed it with MED 1.0
and I wrote an own player routine in assembler. I'm still wondering,
how I got it to work.

As I told him that "Teijo Kinnunen" had registered for FileX, he
was totally bluffed :-)

There you are right!

Oh, you're still living with your parents? Can I ask how old you are?
I'm just eightteen, but don't tell anybody.

Klaas.
