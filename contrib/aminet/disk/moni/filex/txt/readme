NEW FEATURES

     V2.0:

     - Several Files can be edited at the same time. So you can divide
       one window in several editareas (like CED) or even use several
       windows at the same time (like TheEdge or GoldEd).
     - Finally there is a status line in which you can see the current
       cursorposition, the name and the length of the file.
     - Key files for registered users. So it's very easy to get your
       registered version by e-mail.
     - In string gadgets you can select gadget shortcuts with the right
       amiga key now.
     - The clipboard is now supported directly. You don't need to use
       "Load from Clip" or "Save from Clip" anymore.
     - A small calculator for simple operations in hexadecimal, decimal,
       octal or binary.
     - The search requester is even more easy now. There are only two
       string gadgets, one for the search and one for the replace string.
       With a switch you can swap between 'search' and 'search and
       replace'.A history function, like the one in the shell, remembers
       all previously entered search strings.
     - A clipboard converter allows you to convert the contents of the
       clipboard in varius ways. So you can change a textstring,
       including a number, into the right number.
     - FileX remembers all the names of the files read from the
       beginning. Per list requester you can choose old files and open
       them again.
     - The ARexx port has been expanded to support the new functions.
       The command shell is now asynchron.
