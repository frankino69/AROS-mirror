I was attempting to send this stuff by email, but even failed to get
the message on its way :-).. Below's the letter:

Hi again, Klaas!

Thanks a lot for the latest beta of FileX! It looks very nice indeed!!!

Anyway, I found at least one bug (if you think that all have been killed,
there's certainly one more :-)... This happens only when the asl-requesters
are in use. Open ARexx/Execute Command..., you can see that the pattern
is #?.filex. Click cancel. Then choose Project/Open..., you can see that
the same pattern remains, although it shouldn't.

A couple of new suggestions:
* marking range by double-clicking the cursor with the mouse
* when scrolling up/down, if the mouse is moved off the window, the
  scrolling stops - it should continue
* a feature to get the actual memory position of the current byte
  (even when editing files!), sometimes useful when disassembling things :-)

Also in this archive, there's a new Finnish .ct-file for 2.0... I think
it's a bit better translated than the one I did for V1.1. I hope it works
fine.

Please let me know as soon as you receive this so that I don't have to
resend it by mail.

Best regards,

Teijo

P.S. You asked about my age... I'm 19, far too much :-)
