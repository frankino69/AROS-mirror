NAME
       mren - rename an existing MSDOS file

SYNOPSIS
       mren [ -v ] sourcefile targetfile

DESCRIPTION
       Mren renames an existing file on an MSDOS filesystem.

       Mren will allow the following command line option:

       v      Verbose mode.  Display the new filename if the name
              supplied is invalid.

       Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS filename.
       If  an  invalid  MSDOS target name is specified, mren will
       change the name (and prompt the user to accept  or  reject
       the new name if the verbose mode is set).

       The path component of the target filename (if supplied) is
       ignored.  In other words, you may not use mren to  move  a
       file from one subdirectory to another.

       Mren may be used to rename directories.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
       protect them from the shell.

       The mcd command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mread returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.

BUGS
       Unlike the MSDOS version of  REN,  mren  can  be  used  to
       rename directories.
