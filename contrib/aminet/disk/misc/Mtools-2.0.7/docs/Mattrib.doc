NAME
       mattrib - change MSDOS file attribute flags

SYNOPSIS
       mattrib  [ -a|+a ] [ -h|+h ] [ -r|+r ] [ -s|+s ] msdosfile
       [ msdosfiles... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mattrib will add attribute flags to an  MSDOS  file  (with
       the  '+' operator) or remove attribute flags (with the '-'
       operator).

       Mattrib will allow the following command line options:

       a      Archive bit.  Used by some backup programs to indi-
              cate a new file.

       r      Read-only  bit.  Used to indicate a read-only file.
              Files with this bit set cannot be  erased  by  DEL.
              However, mdel is more cunning.

       s      System  bit.  Used by MSDOS to indicate a operating
              system file.

       h      Hidden bit.  Used to make files  hidden  from  DIR.
              However, mdir is more cunning.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
       protect them from the shell.

       The mcd command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mattrib returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure, or 2  on
       partial failure.

BUGS
       Most  MSDOS  versions  of  ATTRIB  don't  allow  this many
       options.
