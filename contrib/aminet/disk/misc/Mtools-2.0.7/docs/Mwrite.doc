NAME
       mwrite - low level write (copy) a Unix file to MSDOS

SYNOPSIS
       mwrite [ -tnvm ] unixfile msdosfile

       mwrite [ -tnvm ] unixfile [ unixfiles... ] msdosdirectory

DESCRIPTION
       In  the  first form, mwrite copies the specified Unix file
       to the named MSDOS file.  The second form of  the  command
       copies multiple Unix files to the named MSDOS directory.

       Mwrite will allow the following command line options:

       t      Text file transfer.  Mwrite will translate incoming
              line feeds to carriage return/line feeds.

       n      No warning.  Mwrite will not  warn  the  user  when
              overwriting an existing file.

       v      Verbose mode.  Display the new filename if the Unix
              filename requires conversion.

       m      Preserve the file modification times.

       If the target file already exists, and the  -n  option  is
       not in effect, mwrite asks whether or not to overwrite the
       file.

       Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS filename.
       If  an  invalid  name is specified, mwrite will change the
       name (and display the new name  if  the  verbose  mode  is
       set).

       MSDOS subdirectory names are are supported with either the
       '/' or '\' separator.  The use of  the  '\'  separator  or
       wildcards  will require the names to be enclosed in quotes
       to protect them from the shell.

       The mcd command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mwrite returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure, or  2  on
       partial failure.

BUGS
       Unlike  MSDOS,  the destination directory may not be omit-
       ted.
