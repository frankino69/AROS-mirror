NAME
       mrd - remove an MSDOS subdirectory

SYNOPSIS
       mrd msdosdirectory [ msdosdirectories... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mrd removes a directory from an MSDOS filesystem.

       An error occurs if the directory is not empty.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require  the directory name to be enclosed in
       quotes to protect it from the shell.

       The mcd command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mrd returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure, or 2 on par-
       tial failure.

SEE ALSO
       mcd(1), mmd(1)

BUGS
       Allows multiple arguments, which does not follow the MSDOS
       convention.
