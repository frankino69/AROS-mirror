NAME
       mdir - display an MSDOS directory

SYNOPSIS
       mdir [ -w ] msdosdirectory

       mdir [ -w ] msdosfile [ msdosfiles...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mdir displays the contents of an MSDOS directory.

       Mdir will allow the following command line option:

       w      Wide  output.  This option will print the filenames
              across the page without displaying the file size or
              creation date.

       An error occurs if a component of the path is not a direc-
       tory.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or  '\'  separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wild-
       cards will require the names to be enclosed in  quotes  to
       protect them from the shell.

       The  mcd  command  may be used to establish the device and
       the current working directory (relative to MSDOS),  other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mdir  returns  0  on  success, 1 on utter failure, or 2 on
       partial failure.

       mcd(1)

BUGS
       Allows multiple arguments, which does not follow the MSDOS
       convention.

       There is no /P (pause) option.
