NAME
       mread - low level read (copy) an MSDOS file to Unix

SYNOPSIS
       mread [ -tnm ] msdosfile unixfile

       mread [ -tnm ] msdosfile [ msdosfiles... ] unixdirectory

DESCRIPTION
       In  the  first form, mread copies the specified MSDOS file
       to the named Unix file.  The second form  of  the  command
       copies multiple MSDOS files to the named Unix directory.

       Mread will allow the following command line options:

       t      Text  file transfer.  Mread will translate incoming
              carriage return/line feeds to line feeds.

       n      No warning.  Mread will  not  warn  the  user  when
              overwriting an existing file.

       m      Preserve the file modification times.

       If  the  target  file already exists, and the -n option is
       not in effect, mread asks whether or not to overwrite  the
       file.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
       protect them from the shell.

       The mcd command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mread returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure,  or  2  on
       partial failure.

       mcd(1), mcopy(1), mtype(1), mwrite(1)

BUGS
       Unlike  MSDOS,  the destination directory may not be omit-
       ted.
