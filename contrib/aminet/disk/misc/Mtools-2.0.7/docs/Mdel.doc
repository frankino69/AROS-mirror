NAME
       mdel - delete an MSDOS file

SYNOPSIS
       mdel [ -v ] msdosfile [ msdosfiles...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mdel deletes a file on an MSDOS filesystem.

       Mdel will allow the following command line option:

       v      Verbose  mode.  Echo the filenames as they are pro-
              cessed.

       Mdel  will  ask  for  verification  prior  to  removing  a
       read-only file.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
       protect them from the shell.

       The mcd command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mdel returns 0 on success, 1 on utter  failure,  or  2  on
       partial failure.

BUGS
       Allows multiple arguments, which does not follow the MSDOS
       convention.
