NAME
       Mtools  -  a  collection  of  tools for manipulating MSDOS
       files

SYNOPSIS
       mattrib - change MSDOS file attribute flags
       mcd - change MSDOS directory
       mcopy - copy MSDOS files to/from Unix
       mdel - delete an MSDOS file
       mdir - display an MSDOS directory
       mformat - add an MSDOS filesystem to a low-level formatted diskette
       mlabel - make an MSDOS volume label
       mmd - make an MSDOS subdirectory
       mrd - remove an MSDOS subdirectory
       mread - low level read (copy) an MSDOS file to Unix
       mren - rename an existing MSDOS file
       mtype - display contents of an MSDOS file
       mwrite - low level write (copy) a Unix file to MSDOS

DESCRIPTION
       Mtools is a public domain collection of programs to  allow
       Unix  systems  to  read, write, and manipulate files on an
       MSDOS filesystem (typically  a  diskette).   Each  program
       attempts  to  emulate  the  MSDOS  equivalent  command  as
       closely as practical.

       MSDOS filenames are optionally composed of a drive  letter
       followed by a colon, a subdirectory, and a filename.  Sub-
       directory names can use either the '/' or  '\'  separator.
       The use of the '\' separator or wildcards will require the
       names to be enclosed in quotes to protect  them  from  the
       shell.

       The  regular expression "pattern matching" routines follow
       the Unix-style rules.  For example, '*' matches all  MSDOS
       files  in  lieu  of '*.*'.  The archive, hidden, read-only
       and system  attribute  bits  are  ignored  during  pattern
       matching.

       Not all Unix filenames are appropriate in the MSDOS world.
       The Mtools commands may have to alter Unix  names  to  fit
       the  MSDOS filename restrictions.  Most commands have a -v
       (verbose) option that will display the new names  if  they
       have  been  changed.  The following table shows some exam-
       ples of filename conversions:

            l l  l.   Unix  name MSDOS  name     Reason  for  the
            change  _    _    _ thisisatest    THISISAT  filename
            too long emmet.gray     EMMET.GRA extension too  long
            prn.txt   XRN.TXT   PRN     is    a    device    name
            hot+cold  HOTXCOLD  illegal character

       All options use the '-' (minus) flag,  not  '/'  as  you'd
       expect in MSDOS.

       The  mcd  command  is used to establish the device and the
       current working directory (relative to the MSDOS  filesys-
       tem), otherwise the default is assumed to be A:/.

       All  the  Mtools  commands return 0 on success, 1 on utter
       failure, or 2 on partial failure.

BUGS
       An unfortunate side effect  of  not  guessing  the  proper
       device (when multiple disk capacities are supported) is an
       occasional error message from the  device  driver.   These
       can be safely ignored.
