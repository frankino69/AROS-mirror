NAME
       mmd - make an MSDOS subdirectory

SYNOPSIS
       mmd [ -v ] msdosdirectory [ msdosdirectories... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mmd makes a new directory on an MSDOS filesystem.

       Mmd will allow the following command line option:

       v      Verbose  mode.   Display  the new directory name if
              the name supplied is invalid.

       Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS directory
       name.   If  an  invalid name is specified, mmd will change
       the name (and display the new name if the verbose mode  is
       set).

       An error occurs if the directory already exists.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require  the directory name to be enclosed in
       quotes to protect it from the shell.

       The mcd command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mmd returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure, or 2 on par-
       tial failure.

SEE ALSO
       mcd(1), mrd(1)

BUGS
       Allows multiple arguments, which does not follow the MSDOS
       convention.
