NAME
       mformat - add an MSDOS filesystem to a low-level formatted
       diskette.

SYNOPSIS
       mformat [ -t tracks ] [ -h heads ] [ -s  sectors  ]  [  -l
       volume label ] drive:

DESCRIPTION
       Mformat adds a minimal MSDOS filesystem (boot sector, FAT,
       and root directory) to a diskette that  has  already  been
       formatted by a Unix low-level format.

       The follow options are supported:

       t      The number of tracks (not cylinders).

       h      The number of heads (sides).

       s      The number of sectors per track.

       l      An optional volume label.

       To  format a diskette at a density other than the default,
       you must supply (at least) those command  line  parameters
       that are different from the default.

       Mformat returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.

       mlabel(1)

BUGS
       Requires a low-level format utility from Unix.

       Doesn't detect (or record) bad block information.
