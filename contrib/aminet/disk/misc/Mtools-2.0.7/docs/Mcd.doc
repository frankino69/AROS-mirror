NAME
       mcd - change MSDOS directory

SYNOPSIS
       mcd [ msdosdirectory ]

DESCRIPTION
       Without  arguments, mcd will report the current device and
       working directory.  Otherwise,  mcd  changes  the  current
       device  and current working directory relative to an MSDOS
       filesystem.

       The environmental variable MCWD may be used to locate  the
       file where the device and current working directory infor-
       mation is stored.  The default is '$HOME/.mcwd'.  Informa-
       tion  in  this  file is ignored if the file is more than 6
       hours old.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or  '\'  separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wild-
       cards will require the directory name to  be  enclosed  in
       quotes to protect it from the shell.

       Mcd returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.

SEE ALSO
       mdir(1)

BUGS
       Unlike  MSDOS versions of CD, mcd can be used to change to
       another device.

       It may be wise to remove old .mcwd files at logout.
