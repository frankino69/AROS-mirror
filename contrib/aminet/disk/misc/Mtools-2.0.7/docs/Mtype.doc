NAME
       mtype - display contents of an MSDOS file

SYNOPSIS
       mtype [ -ts ] msdosfile [ msdosfiles... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mtype displays the specified MSDOS file on the screen.

       Mtype will allow the following command line options:

       t      Text  file  viewing.  Mtype will translate incoming
              carriage return/line feeds to line feeds.

       s      Strip high bit.  Mtype will strip the high bit from
              the data.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
       protect them from the shell.

       The mcd command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mtype returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure,  or  2  on
       partial failure.

SEE ALSO
       mcd(1), mread(1)

BUGS
       Allows multiple arguments, which does not follow the MSDOS
       convention.
