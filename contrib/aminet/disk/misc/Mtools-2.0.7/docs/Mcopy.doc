NAME
       mcopy - copy MSDOS files to/from Unix

SYNOPSIS
       mcopy [ -tnvm ] sourcefile targetfile

       mcopy [ -tnvm ] sourcefile [ sourcefiles... ] targetdirec-
       tory

DESCRIPTION
       Mcopy copies the specified file  to  the  named  file,  or
       copies  multiple files to the named directory.  The source
       and target can be either MSDOS or Unix files.

       The use of a drive letter designation on the MSDOS  files,
       'a:'  for  example, determines the direction of the trans-
       fer.  A missing drive  designation  implies  a  Unix  file
       whose path starts in the current directory

       Mcopy will allow the following command line options:

       t      Text  file transfer.  Mcopy will translate incoming
              carriage return/line feeds to line feeds.

       n      No warning.  Mcopy will  not  warn  the  user  when
              overwriting an existing file.

       v      Verbose mode.

       m      Preserve the file modification time.

       If  the  target  file already exists, and the -n option is
       not in effect, mcopy asks whether or not to overwrite  the
       file.

       MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
       or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator  or  wild-
       cards  will  require the names to be enclosed in quotes to
       protect them from the shell.

       The mcd command may be used to establish  the  device  and
       the  current working directory (relative to MSDOS), other-
       wise the default is A:/.

       Mcopy returns 0 on success, 1 on utter failure,  or  2  on
       partial failure.

SEE ALSO
       mcd(1), mread(1), mwrite(1)

BUGS
       Unlike  MSDOS,  the destination directory may not be omit-
       ted.

       The '+' operator (append) from MSDOS is not supported.

       No other Mtools command requires the use of a drive letter
       designation on MSDOS files.
