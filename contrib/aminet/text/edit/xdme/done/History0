CM - Code Modification
BR - Bug Report

	Changes Bernd Noll

    CM - (12.8.94) Made the Files Src/Var/* Src/Mod/* Src/Key/* gcc-compilable
    BF - (12.8.94) wbstarted XDME refused to save a file, that had a Def.icon
	 (io.c)
    NF - (12.8.94) Special Flag "saveicons" also for cli-started processes
	 (replacement of "Wdisabled", which had the opposite effect) (main.c,
	 io.c, global.h)
    BF - (12.8.94) "showlog" had obviously never worked (command.c)
   !BR - (13.8.94) Resizing may lead to Redraw Problems (reported 15.8)
   !BR - (13.8.94) Overlapping windows may lead to Redraw Problems in
	 connection w/ blocks (reported 15.8)
   fBR - (13.8.94) Shift-Selecting Defaulticons won't load them (reported 15.8)
   !BR - (14.8.94) WindowRefresh on an inactive window causes CommandlineMode
	 be FALSE (that behaviour was not noticed in XDME v1.82) (reported 15.8)
    CM - (15.8.94) moved Src/Var/VarStack.c into Src/Mod since this is only a
	 support module (preparing replacement of Src/Var/* by a more flexible
	 concept with a little bit more structure)
    CM - (15.8.94) we are using "IDCMP_INACTIVE" to make sure the title looks ok
	 (win.c, main.c)
    NF - (15.8.94) the variable "iconname" (NO Special Variable) is controlling
	 the used icon image; if there is no such variable set or the according
	 ".info" file is not found, we use the internal image. (io.c)
	 (that variable should per default point to "ENV:Sys/def_Text.info")
    BF - (15.8.94) Removed a bug in "saveicons" (did not use the full appname)
    BF - (15.8.94) Removed a bug in "showlog" (there is still one left: we do
	 not check, if there is already a log window open) (win.c)
    NF - (15.8.94) added command "readtemplate" to insert a file and replace
	 some variable-references by their values; added file "Src/Mod/tplter.c"
    BF - (15.8.94) Shell-vars were not recognized like ENV vars; replaced some
	 FileAccess ("ENV:") by calls to DosLib (Get/Set-Var) (I had forgotten
	 to replace vars.c by my own module ...) (vars.c)
   !BR - (15.8.94) "clipins" does not recognize "\n" and "\t"; I would strongly
	 suggest usage of mikro/m_write instead of text_write (m_write does use
	 it, however) (same thing for ImpliedWrite) (reported 15.8)
    NF - Flag to control, if the title is using TPEN or the Intuition color
	 (not accessible yet) (win.c, global.h)

Version 1.83.09-1ps

	Changes Bernd Noll

    CF - (18.8.94) SIMPTR now uses pixel values ... (macros.c)

Version 1.83.09-2ps

	Changes Bernd Noll

    BF - (21.8.94) "if/ifelse/while cb ..." would not work if Cursor at
	 blockborder (e.g. block.topline) (cmd.c)
    BF - (21.8.94) Fixed Bug from 13.8.: DefIcons would not be accepted
	 via WB-start; (main.c)
   ?BR - (21.8.94) There seems to be a gap between the Iconify- and the
	 WindowDepth- Gadgets in WindowTitle (may anyone prove that?)
	 (reported ?.?)
   ?BR - (21.8.94) man teste die folgenden schritte ...
	 1. oeffne 2 Fenster, beide vollstaendig sichtbar
	 2. >map a-a (pop block)
	 3. markiere in Fenster 1 einen Block (z.B. >top bstart pagedown bend)
	 4. >push block
	 5. gehe nach fenster 2, iconifiziere es, klicke das Icon an
	 6. bei aktiviertem icon von Fenster 2	a-a druecken
	 7. Fenster 1 aktivieren, cursor innerhalb des Blocks bewegen ...
   ?SG - Wir sollten dringend in text.c die Referenzen zu "Ep" tilgen ...
   ?BR - (21.8.94) Ist es Absicht, dass einige Spcvars in command.c zu
	 finden sind, und nicht in SmallSpc.c? Da bereits Aenderungen
	 in SmallSpc. von anderen Personen durchgefuehrt wurden, ist
	 anzunehmen, dass die Bedeutung dieses Moduls bekannt ist.
    CM - (22.8.94) made some files gcc-compatible (amiga.c, block.c/defs.h,
	 win.c) now almost all files compile w/ no gcc-warnings (I had to
	 modify the c=bm includes/clib/(exec|dos)_protos.h, though)
   ?BR - (22.8.94) JOIN disturbs Blocks, when LineMode && nextline == only
	 line in Block, only the join-char appears Blocked, but the current
	 and the next line are blocked. (reported ?.?)

Version 1.83.10

	Changes Bernd Noll

    NF - (4.9.94) variable interface "intuitiontitles" to switch on
	 SetWindowTitles instead of the old method (smallspc.c)
    NF - (4.9.94) variable interface to "dobak" (no effect yet) (s.a.)
    NF - (4.9.94) variable interface to "tfpen" title foreground pen
	 (s.a.)
    CF - (4.9.94) renamed variable interface "tpen" for title background pen
	 to "tbpen", since there is also "tfpen" (s.a.)
    CM - (4.9.94) eliminated some "dead assignments" in Mod/*
    BF - (4.9.94) reported & corrected a newly introduced bug in "showlog"
    BF - (4.9.94) re-incorporated bugfixes of 1.9.94 (menu*.c)
    BF - (4.9.94) corrected a +/- sign in AVL.c (why did nobody report that!?)
