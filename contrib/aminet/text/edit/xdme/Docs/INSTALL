The installating is pretty simple:

    1. copy XDME to any desired place
       (that place should be in your path though :-)

    2. Rename your beloved S:.edrc-file to "S:.edrc_user".
       The new S:.edrc will always source that file. If you
       do not already have a .edrc-file, you should copy
       the empty s/.edrc_user file or you will get a
       (harmless) error that "s:.edrc_user" cannot be read.

    3. Copy s/.edrc to S:.edrc. XDME will always read that file
       on startup.

    4. If you want to use the EXECUTE-command (start a CLI-command
       from within XDME, you also need the NULL-handler which is
       supplied with the old version of DME. I do not ship this
       because I'll remove the NULL-dependancy as soon as I know
       WHY EXECUTE needs the NULL:.

Have fun !
