XDME		Version 1.54 of Matt's text editor.  XDME is a not so simple
		WYSIWYG editor designed for programmers.  It is not a
		WYSIWYG word processor in the traditional sense.  Features
		include arbitrary key mapping, FAST scrolling, title-line
		statistics multiple windows, and ability to iconify windows.
		This new version has some bugs fixed, many new commands and
		several other new enhancements. Update to version 1.45 on
		disk number 530, includes source.
