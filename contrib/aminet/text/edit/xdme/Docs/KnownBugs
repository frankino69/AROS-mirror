Here is a list of known BUGS (not ! features) in XDME V1.83.03:

    - SOMETIMES, XDME WRITES A 0-BYTE RANDOMLY IN THE TEXT. CAN ANYONE
      VERIFY THIS ?

    - XDME still has some problems in handling memory. I was reported of
      unchecked AllocMem()s and malloc()s. Also XDME will surely crash if you
      e.g. produce too many lines (i.e. "top block bottom block downadd
      repeat -1 bcopy" will crash XDME).
    - If you load a file in another directory and select PROJECTSAVE in this
      window, the XDME_Project_File is written to that directory. This is not
      actually a bug, but may cause confusion.
    - two bugs in PREV. I hope the search NEXT is bug-free :-) Has someone a
      Boyer-Moore search that searches reverse (ie. from the end of the
      text to the beginning) ???
