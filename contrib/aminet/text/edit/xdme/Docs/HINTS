In this file I'll put some hints&tips together. You can send me such hints
and I'll incorporate them !

1. The Paging after the StyleGuide:

Well we all have seen much crap from CBM yet and the StypeGuide won't be
the last thing :-( Anyway most things in the StyleGuide are ok and
reasonable BUT:

    If you don't like how the SG wants an editor to do PAGING, try the
following:

    map s-left	c-left
    map s-right last
    map s-up	`screentop pageup'
    map s-down	`screenbottom pagedown'

"Sorry for the inconvenience" :-)

2. Dirk told me a little trick for GLOBAL search. You may have noticed that
XDME is not yet able to search through ALL open windows. He did the following:

    map A-s `escimm (set searchfor \`) findstr \$searchfor next'
    map A-r `escimm (set searchfor \`) findstr \$searchfor escimm (set repwith \`) repstr \$repwith nextr'

Now you can iconify the window and type "search #?.c $searchfor" in the shell.

I'm working on a global search right now :-)

3. The following routine walks through all windows:

    select save
    select first
    while selnext ``I was here :-)''
    select load
