Subject: New block.c and associated files

The enclosed archive contains all the files that I have changed
from the pl11 release to implement the new Block structure.  Note
that it doesn't actually do the cut/copy/paste/bmove/bdelete/...
stuff yet, but it has taken a bit of work to get the changes in
to this point.	I wanted to get synchronized with you as far as
these modules go so that I wouldn't have to fit these changes into
another patch level release.

I used 'diff -w myxdme:xxxx XDMEpl11:xxxx' for all the files to
figure out which ones had been changed.  I hope you can work this
in before other major changes happen.  Now I can start doing what
I started to do in the first place, and that is to impliment
block operation on all the block types.  That should be a lot
easier now.  Unfortunately I wasted a lot of time trying to figure
out how xdme does block highlighting and text redrawing.  I'm still
not sure I found all the places that have an effect on the display,
but redraw.c is much smaller now and never even references
ActualBlock.type!

Here's the log from lha so you can see what's in here.
