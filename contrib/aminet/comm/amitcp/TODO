* Squash bugs
* figure out what exactly the config_vars.awk script does
  and what config_vars.c is used for.

  After it starts working:

* Remove any dependencies on environment variables, if at all
  possible.
* Relocate configuration files to a sensible place in the
  ADE: tree.

* Get the devices and inet-handler ported.  Someone could start
working on this now.  No reliance on amitcp-specific includes if
possible.

* Someone outside the US should work on usergroup.library, since 
 it has a working crypt.c, though I'm not sure what Fred will do about
 this.  

* Port the amitcp utilities with ixemul/ixnet. Hopefully most won't be
  any harder than ifconfig (write a Makefile, fix a couple of headers).
  Note having a NetBSD source tree can be handy if there are some 
  undefined structures.  Eventually, these could/will be replaced by
  NetBSD ports (but those will also rely on more networking capability
  than ixemul provides currently).
