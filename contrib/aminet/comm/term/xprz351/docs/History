1.0, 29 Jul 89 - Original release.

1.1,  03 Aug 89 - Fixed zsdata() to send file data packet in one swrite()
                  call instead of calling zsendline for every byte, to prevent
                  hammering the serial.device with single-byte write requests
                  during uploads, and to speed up effective data transmission
                  rates.

2.0,  28 Oct 89 - Converted from Manx to Lattice C 5.04.  Created prototypes and
                  made other tweaks as required.  Designed new library skeleton
                  for Lattice code, replacing the old Manx library skeleton.
                  Added new options TC, A, D, K, S, R, and P.  Added support for
                  xpr_options() callback routine, and generally brought things
                  up to par with XPR Spec 2.0.

2.10, 12 Feb 91 - Fixed the following generally minor problems:

  o  No longer munges A6 register (this was potentially serious), and added
     callback glue to ensure comm program can't munge OUR registers either.
     Decided that the protective glue was much safer than the more elegant
     direct invocation used in version 2.0.

  o  Slightly less transmission overhead (concatenates all output into single
     swrites, builds output packets a bit faster).

  o  Considerably less receive overhead; does a lot more waiting and a lot
     fewer sreads, especially at high speed.  WARNING: this change doesn't
     work with VLT version 4.846 or earlier (yes, Willy; it really was
     broken B-)).  This change may or may not actually do you any good,
     depending upon how your comm program implements the xpr_sread() function.

  o  Fixed problems getting synchronized with some systems on uploads.

  o  No longer closes files twice.

  o  Now uses fully-reentrant sprintf() from amiga.lib; no more nasty BSS.

  o  A couple of obscure error messages were > 50 bytes long, causing problems
     with some comm program's transfer status windows, e.g. the infamouse VLT
     "Incredible Shrinking Status Window."

  o  Stabilized spastic data rate by computing elapsed time more accurately.

  o  Fixed sprintf() error which caused invalid filelength to be sent on
     uploads.

  o  Aligned all data for optimal performance on 68030++ CPUs (now that I have
     my A3000... B-)).  Doesn't really make any noticeable difference, but it
     makes us 68030 owners feel better anyway.  I'm also including a version of
     the library compiled for the 68020+ CPU, on the same principle.

  o  Now uses .DUP2 instead of .DUP.DUP, etc.

  o  Added config option E for number of errors which cause an abort.

  o  Fixed bogus IO_Torture false alarm concerning timer.device.

  o  Tried to fix an elusive Enforcer hit on reading location 0, but I'm not
     sure I really got it, since I had trouble reproducing the problem.

2.50, 15 Nov 91 - Fixed bugs and added the following features:

  o  Added code to support 32 bit CRC (Circular Redundancy Check).
     CRC-32 adds a little more protection to the data being sent
     and received than does CRC-16.  Source for the CRC-32 additions
     came from the Unix version of RZ/SZ by Chuck Forsberg.

  o  Added code to update_rate() function in utils.c to avoid the
     Guru # 80000005 if you decide to adjust the system clock during an
     upload or download from Daylight Saving Time to Standard Time.  :-)

  o  Proto additions using libinit.o and libent.o, and eliminating all
     of the assembler code was supplied by Jim Cooper of SAS.  Jim
     also supplied the mysprintf() code to replace sprintf().  This
     version of XprZmodem can be compiled with the SAS version 5.10 C Compiler.
     I do not know how well it might compile with the Aztec compiler.


   2.50     update_rate()  fixed fatal error in current-duration
                           calculation.  Caused 80000005 Guru.

            sprintf()      replaced with Mysprintf() routine.
                           Thanks to Jim Cooper of the SAS institude
                           for  the libinit and linent objects.

            Cyclic Redunduncy Check now uses a 32-bit hard-coded CRC table.
            CRC-32 release by Bill Perkins.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is basically version 2.50.  I just changed rx_timout from 600 to
30 in send.c to fix uploads so they truly work.

NOTE:  I compiled the 020 version using lattice 5.10b (as well as the
       none '020 version), but since I only have a 68000, I don't know how
       well or if it works.

------

Recompiled the 2.51 020 version as 2.52 after fixing the LmkFile.020 file.
Internal name of the library was being compiled as XprZmodem.Library.020
rather than as XprZmodem.Library.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.51, 29 Jan 92 - Rxtimeout changed from 600 to 300 for upload timeout
                  problem by John Tillema.

2.52, 06 Mar 92 - Recompile code for 68020 library code.  Non-68020 code worked
                  fine but John Tillema was not able to test the 2.51 68020
                  version.

 3.2 - Added support for FTN operations and FTN Zmodem-derivative protocols

    It  seems  that Yves Koingshofer was not given credit for such features
    as  dos.library  usage,  variable  block-size, 8 K blocks etc.  Perhaps
    these  changes  were  done  independantly  to  Yves's xprzedzap.library
    derviative  or  perhaps credit for his work was inadvertandly left out.
    Since  xprzedzap.library received wide release via AmiNet, and has been
    in  use  with  numerous BBS's and Term programs as well as with mailers
    such  as  JAZ,  POP,  RAP, GAZEBO, PORTICUS, UMBRELLA and JAMMAIL for a
    number of years, I found it strange no credit was given to Yves who
    put  so  much  effort  into  this  work. 
    Credit  was  also  not  given  to Russell McOrmond, one of the founding
    members of the XPR list whose format.a was renamed to xprsprintf.a with
    only slight modifications. 

    These oversights are rectified here. 

    Those few changes of Yves's that did not cross over from xprzedzap.library
    versions  .55,  .85, 1.00 and 1.5 (all based upon xprzmodem 2.52 source)
    or were used without providing a setup option for modification have been
    added here, with some changes of my own to simplify operations when the
    protocol is used in mailers.

    Code-Changes by Robert Williamson, in consultation with Yves
    Konigshofer.  Although Yves no longer has an Amiga, he was kind enough
    to  spend many, many hours with me on the phone, discussing the various
    problems  and  solutions  involved  in  producing  these libaraies.  My
    thanks to him are heartfelt.

    General:

    A number of strings were not localized, corrected.

    Only wb2.1+ versions supported
    Removed  all  extra  makefiles  and  replaced  with  a general one using
    macros.

    Added  callbacks.a  -  Protection  of ALL registers used for callback
    functions is restored.
    
    XPR 3 xpr_updstatus function is enabled, permitting notification
    of transfer status for EACH file sent or received.

    Changed most references to KSIZE as a defined constant to use local
    variable v-Ksize instead.

    Compiler DEFINE ZEDZAP causes certain code sections to be replaced with
    xpr-friendly  versions  from  xprzedzap  source  or  new code inserted.
    These  changes  should  be compatible with usage of the library in pure
    Zmodem mode.

    Note that set up Defaults are different with xprzedzap.library.

    FN       Disable FTN mode  

    New Setup options: 

    Z   - FTN mode
    The Z option enables FTN operation, when Y, the following is in effect:
        - RxTimeOut is restored to 600ms
        - transfers start with blocksize specified in M option.
        - serialbuffer is cleared before sending/recving.  In FTN
          mode the turnaround from sending to receiveng (and vis-versa)
          is quite fast, clearing the buffer avoids reading echos of our
          own characters or leftovers from the previous transfer.

    C<link bps>
    Buffer  size,  and  cps  calculations  will  be based upon link rate if
    passed  with  C<baud> option, otherwise they will be based upon LOCKED
    bps.

    N   - send no files mode (DirectZap,  ZedZip  and  ZedZap protocols)
    It is permitted to have a session without sending or receiving files if
    N  option is Y.  This is required with some protocols in FTN mode so as
    not  to  generate a spurious failure after a mailer session.  This also
    chnages EOF mode from sending CAN's to just sending ZFIN.
        
    Q   - DirectZap mode
    Only ZDLE adn ZDLEE will be escaped is Q option is Y (DirectZap protocol)

    Changes in status display:

    XPR 2.001 support for dual-status windows added.

    Protocol name displayed will be one of: 
        Zmodem, 1K blocks standard, up to 8K, non-ftn mode
        ZedZap, up to 8K Blocks based upon bps rate, ftn mode
        ZedZip, 1k blocks , ftn mode
        DirectZap, up to 8k blocks, minimum escaping, ftn mode

    Added  localization  for  new  options.   These  are NOT translated for
    german catalog, so that catalog has been removed from distribution.

    During  batch  transfers,  Error  message  field is set to "None" when
    starting to send or receive next file.

 3.2a (no change in Version number)
    Corrected  DirectZap xfer failure problem
    "Resuming" message was ALWAYS was being printed at start of xfer
    if  (OR)  resume was enabled.  Now only printed if Starting position is
    not 0.
 3.3
    Finished dual-display support, tested with JamMail
 3.4
    Protocol names were not being displayed correctly on receive.
 3.5 
    Added setup option switch to enable/disable XPR2.001 extensions.
    Default is NO for xprzmodem.library and Y for xprzedzap.library.
3.51
    Fixed  improper variable names in setup which caused unexpected results
    with TERM.
    History removed from Guide file
    Merged xprzedzap.doc into Guide file
    Catalog source now included in BOTH source and user archives
