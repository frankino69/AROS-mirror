Is it Public Domain?

  TT is NOT Public Domain. TT is 'Freely distributable
  copyrighted software with a shareware option'.

  "Permission is hereby granted to copy TT provided that
   the copyright notice and this document is left intact.
   Copies may not be made for profit."

  I don't know if the above should hold in court but what
  I mean is: Copy TT if you want to but don't make a
  business of it. It is of course free to include it on
  public domain disks or putting it on a BBS.
  If you find TT useful, please feel free to send a
  donation ($10 is a nice round number) or a nice program (PD).
  Please don't send personal checks. It costs me $5 to
  cash them. Or you can buy me a beer or two when we meet.
  If you wish to include TT with a commercial product,
  please contact me first. I just want to make sure that
  my ego can stand for it. Of course it would also be nice
  with a registered copy of the product.


What is it?

  TT is a very small communications program. I got fed up
  with 100+ KBytes communications programs that had millions
  of options, buttons, bells and whistles.
  TT is
    * small (approximately 13 KBytes)
    * uses no chipmem (runs in the CLI)
    * has no built-in protocol (uses the XPR standard)
    * does no terminal emulation (ANSI is good enough for most BBSing)
    * doesn't have any phonebook.


Starting

  TT accepts a couple of command line arguments.

  Argument              Specifies                       Example
  --------              ---------                       -------
  -S serial.device      The device                      -Ssupra.device

  -U n                  The device unit                 -U3

  -P protocol           The XPR protocol                -Pzmodem

  -K keymap             The keymap                      -Ks

  -F font/size          Name and size of the font.      -Ftopaz/8

  -D xferdirectory      Upload/download directory.      -Dsys:transfer

  Everything else that is specified on the command line is
  sent to the modem. A newline is inserted after each word
  on the command line.
  Example: TT ATDT555-4132

  I have found that the easiest way to use TT is to have a
  couple of aliases, where each alias is a host that I want
  to call.
  Example:
    alias npd "TT -Pzmodem ATDT112196"
    alias dogs "TT -Pzmodem ATDT261204"
  When I want to call a host, I simply type the name of it.


Running

  When TT is running, you can use a couple of command keys.
  Hold down the right Amiga key and type the appropriate
  character.

    P   prompts for a new XPR protocol.

    D   prompts for a filename and downloads that file.

    U   prompts for a filename and uploads that file.

    Q   exits TT.


That's all folks

  That's it. Now you know how to use TT. Doesn't seem too
  hard, does it? Have fun.


The future

  Fixing the bugs. I can't find any at the moment, but I'm
  sure there are some.
  ARexx, ARexx, ARexx!


Note to programmers

  I'm sure that a lot of programmers will find the source code
  interesting. It explains how to do asynchronous IO in the
  CLI. It took some job getting it right.
  It also provides a complete working (well :-) example of how
  to use the XPR standard.
