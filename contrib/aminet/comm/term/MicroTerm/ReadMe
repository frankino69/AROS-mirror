-------------------------------------------------------------------

Microterm is a little terminal program that I wrote while learning
to use the serial.device and the console.device.  It is a particularly
"unfeatured" terminal program, it does not even have an ASCII capture
mode...  I thought it would be useful as an example of how to talk
to the serial and console devices and so I have placed this code in
the public domain.

To compile, if you are a Manx user type "make" (compiled under 3.6)
if not you may have to edit a line or two of the makefile to build the
precompiled include file...
