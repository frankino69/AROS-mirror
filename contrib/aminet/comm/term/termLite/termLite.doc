`termLite'  is the little brother of `term'.  It is a very, very basic
telecommunications   program   which   solely  relies  on  the  serial
parameter  settings  configured  using  the  Prefs/Serial  tool.  As a
terminal  program `termLite' is merely in an embryonal state, its main
purpose  being  a  simple interface to the serial/parallel hardware (I
used  it  to  control  RomWack from a remote machine).  The program is
pure and can be made resident.  On startup you may pass it the name of
the  device  to  use  and  the  device's unit number.  Cut & paste are
supported through the console.  Source code and executable program are
placed in the public domain, enjoy.
