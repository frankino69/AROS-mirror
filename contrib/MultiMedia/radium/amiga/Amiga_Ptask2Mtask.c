/************* overview ********************************

	The player-task sometimes needs to let the main-task
	do some of its work. The Ptask2Mtask function is
	called from the player-task, and
	recieves a pointer to a function that must be called
	from the main-task with 'pointer' as argument.

	The player-task could do all this work by itself, but
	that would slow down and allso make it pretty complicated
	because semaphores or things like that has to be
	added.

	Used when scrolling, change of block, etc.

	NOTE. The main-task doesn't have to be finished processing
	the function before Ptask2Mtask is called again.
