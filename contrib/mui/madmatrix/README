This is MadMatrix sources, written by Olivier Croquette ( ocroquette@nordnet.fr ).

Just type 'make' to compile them with gcc.

Please make feedback if this package was useful to you !



Note : sorry to mix english/french in sources, but as they are quite clean, it should be
       no problem for you to understand.
Note2: there's some dirty things in those sources, please do not blame me for that !
       I'll fix them as soon as I've some time.
