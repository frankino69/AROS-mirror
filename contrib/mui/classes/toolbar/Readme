This archive contains two classes to be used with MUI (Magic User Interface).

----

Toolbar.mcc is released under the concept of Polymorphware. This means that
whatever you demand of your users I will demand from you. A couple of examples
might make it clearer. If your software uses my class and you have released
it as postcard-ware then you have to mail me a postcard. If you have released
it as shareware then you have to pay me the shareware-fee.

There is one exception though. Commercial software-developers will have to
contact me to get an explicit permission to use my class.

This concept was first used by Allan Odgaard :)

----

InfoText.mcc is freeware. You can use it in whatever you like even
commercial programs.

If you want to see what is new or changed then please look in the
AmigaGuide file: Docs/Toolbar.guide.

I take no responsibility in any damage caused by these classes. If you find
any bugs or have any new ideas you are welcome to write me an email.
