From Marcin Orlowski per e-mail:

If that suffice I grant you (or aros project) a permission to do 
whatever you need to do with this class or other I released as well
as alter, change etc. its source code to make it work with AROS.
I no longer develop it but if you find it useful - go ahead and use it.
