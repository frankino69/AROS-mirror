MCC Mailtext - README

  As of June 11,2006 Olaf Peters has given his approval to the
  Mailtext Open Source Team to change the Mailtext licensing to
  LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License).

Original Readme by Olaf Peters releasing Mailtext under GPL:

  This is the sourcecode for the MUI Custom Class Mailtext. I'm
  releasing it to the OpenSource community, because I don't have the
  time (and resources = Amiga) to actively support it any longer, in
  fact MCC Mailtext has been unsupported for almost 3 years now...

  Should somebody decide to take up the project and further develop it,
  I would appreciate if SourceForge (http://sf.net/) would be used as a
  supportive means to allow more developers to get involved into the
  project.

  Of course you may contact me with any questions concerning the
  package and I will happily try to answer them.

LICENSE NOTICE

  The documentation/readmes contained in the Sourcecode archive still
  state a somewhat restricted license. As MCC Mailtext is now under GPL,
  these notes are now obsolete, e.g. you don't need a commercial license
  to use MCC Mailtext in commercial products. The documentation must be
  changed before the next final release to reflect the migration to the
  GPL.
