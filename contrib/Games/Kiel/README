This is a package of some tiny games I started to program some time ago.
This is the pre-release of some of them.

DESCRIPTIONS:
-------------
Mine -	is a clone of the well known game Mine-Sweeper.
	The main feature provided with this version is a solving-helper,
	which does all the 'dirty' work, i.e. the clicking-around at
	obvious places.

Jump -	is a solitair game on which you have to jump with one stone across
	another (next to it, which has to be in the same row or column) which
	will then be removed. You win when you managed to remove all stones
	exept one, which should be in the middle.
JumpEd-	is the Editor for the starting-combination of the above game.

Quad -	is another solitair game. First, you choose the starting combination
	on the left half and the finish combination on the right half, then
	the game is started with the start button. It can be aborted with the
	stop-button and quit with escape. You try to get both sides match
	while pushing unpressed gadgets on the left side.
	a short map:  1  2  3
	              4  5  6
	              7  8  9

	If you push 5, 2,4,5,6,8 are inverted
	If you push 2, 1,2,3 are inverted, 4->1,4,7;6->3,6,9;8->7,8,9
	If you push 1, 1,2,4,5 are inverted, 3->2,3,5,6;7->4,5,7,8;9->5,6,8,9

Rotate-	is an experimental game. You get an heap of colored tiles.
	By pressing on one tile you rotate the tiles around this tile
	anti-clockwise. If four or more tiles with the same color are in a
	row, these tiles are deleted and the tiles above fall down.
	Goal is to lower the height of the heap beneath a certain level or
	to delete as many tiles as possible with a certain number of rotates
	or to use as litte rotates as possible to delete a ceratin number of
	tiles.

Wumpus-	Is the well-known game in which you have to hunt for Wumpus in his
	caves.
