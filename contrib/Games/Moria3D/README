Needed    : MC68030/AGA
          : MC68000/AGA if you recompile, but who likes slideshows?

Recomended: 040/40 CGFX

BUGS      : No compatibility problems, crashes or hangs have been reported

            - The clipping sometimes has bugs not drawing everything and
              slowing it down awfully.
              (Try Level.03)
            - Monsters are not drawn correctly, They are just hacked in.
            - Monsters are not light mapped.
