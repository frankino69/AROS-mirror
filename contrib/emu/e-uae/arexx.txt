AREXX PORT
===========

AROS hint:
Commands which should return a value in the variable "RESULT"
aren't working yet.


This section is rather for experienced user or programmers that want to
enhance UAE or to replace MUIRexx GUI.

UAE provides an AREXX port through which you can set or retrieve
internal parameters or variables such as the state of the joystick
emulation or the framerate and so on. Is also implements a "feedback"
mecanism so that a GUI piloting UAE through the AREXX port can hear
about dynamical modification of UAE variables such as led states and
the like. The port name is "UAE". If that port already exists, UAE
will disable it's AREXX feature (that is to say if you have 2 copies
of UAE running on your system, only one will have an AREXX port. I
doubt anyone will try to run 2 UAE in the same time :-).

The commands that need a string argument accepts quoted strings. If
the string is not quoted then it is the following word that will be
used. The quotes can be single (') or double ("). They must match (eg.
if you begin with ('),then you must end your string with (') too).
Within a string, you can use a backslash (\) to express escape
sequences. For example, "This 'is' a \"string\"." represents the
string (This 'is' a "string"). I hope you get it :-)

Here is a list of the available commands:

        * BYE
        * QUIT
                This make the emulator exit.

        * RESET
                This makes a hard-reset of the emulator.

        * DEBUG
                This forces the emulator to enter in debugging mode.

        * EJECT <num>
                This will eject the disk in drive <num> (from 0 to 3).

        * INSERT <num> <filename>
                This will insert the filedisk <filename> in drive unit
                <num>. 

        * FRAMERATE <num>
                This sets the framerate to <num> (1 <= <num> <= 20).
                It is a way to overwrite the -f flag of UAE.

        * VERSION <arg>         (<arg> = NUM | AUTHOR | PORT | STRING)
                This places in the AREXX 'RESULT' variable some
                information about UAE's version. 

                NUM returns a numerical value that is to be interpreted
                as UAEMAJOR*10000 + UAEMINOR*100 + UAESUBREV (ie. uae
                v0.6.4 will return "604").

                AUTHOR returns the original author of UAE (ie. Bernd
                Schmidt). 

                PORT returns the name of the port author (that's me!:-)
                
                STRINGS returns a summary string made with the above
                strings. 

        * DISPLAY <arg>         (<arg> = ON | OFF | TOGGLE)
                This will enable or disable the display rendering.

        * FAKEJOYSTICK <arg>    (<arg> = ON | OFF | TOGGLE)
                This will enable or disable the joystick emulation. It
                is a way to overwrite the -J flag from the command
                line. 

        * SOUND <arg>           (<arg> = ON | OFF | BEST)
                This sets the state of the sound emulation (see option
                '-S' on the command line). BEST is the same as using
                the -S3 switch on the commandline.

        * QUERY <var>
                This asks UAE's for its internal variables. That
                state is written in the arexx 'RESULT' variable. So
                don't forget to put 'OPTIONS RESULTS' in your arexx
                scripts. 

                <var> can be one of the following:

                * FAKEJOYSTICK => returns "1" if the joystick
                  emulation is ON and "0" if it is OFF.

                * DISPLAY => returns "1" if the display is not
                  inhibited and "0" otherwise.

                * FRAMERATE => returns the current framerate (see
                  option -f).

                * SOUND => returns "0" if the sound is not emulated
                  (ie. uae -S0 was used). "1" is returned when the
                  sound is OFF (think about uae -S1). "2" means the
                  sound emulation is ON and "3" means it is the best
                  sound-emulation that is used (uae -S3).

                * NAME_DF0
                * NAME_DF1
                * NAME_DF2
                * NAME_DF3 => returns the name of the diskfile used in
                  the indicated unit.
                  
                * LED_DF0
                * LED_DF1
                * LED_DF2
                * LED_DF3 => returns "1" if the drive led is hilighted
                  and "0" if the led is OFF.

                * LED_POW => returns "1" if the powerled is ON and "0"
                  otherwise. 

        * UAEEXE [run] <executable> <args>
                This will make UAE lauch the <executable> provided 
                you've previouly starded uae_rcli. If <executable> is 
                "QUIT", then the "uae_rcli" process will exit(). Note 
                that you must use "run" in order to launch the 
                executable as an asynchronous command.

        * FEEDBACK <eventname> PORT|ADDRESS <portname>
                               CMD_ON|CMD|CMD_OFF <cmd> 
                That command needs a special explanation:

                <eventname> is the name of an internal UAE event. It
                can be any of:
                   ON_EXIT (UAE is about to quit),
                   LED_POW (the power led has changed),
                   LED_DF0 (led of drive DF0 has changed),
                   LED_DF1 (the same, but for DF1),
                   LED_DF2 (well...),
                   LED_DF3 (guess!),
                   NAME_DF0 (name of filedisk df0 has changed),
                   NAME_DF1 (obvious),
                   NAME_DF2 (ditto),
                   NAME_DF3 (...).

                <portname> is the name of an AREXX port. It can be
                "COMMAND" in which case <cmd> is interpreted as DOS
                command. 

                <cmd> is a string containing a command that UAE will
                send to <portname> when the event matching <eventname>
                occur.  

                Each event has 2 available <cmd>s. One is set by the
                CMD_ON keyword, the other by CMD_OFF. CMD_ON can be
                abreviated to CMD.

                When the event is the name of a led (LED_POW, LED_DF0,
                ...), it is the <cmd> associated to CMD_ON that will be
                sent to <portname> if the led is hilighted. It is the
                <cmd> of the CMD_OFF argument that will be used if the
                led is dimmed. I think you need an example to make it
                clear (no pun intended :)

                If you issue the command:

                        address UAE feedback LED_POW PORT COMMAND
                        CMD_ON "list t:" CMD_OFF "list s:" 

                Then UAE will issue "list t:" when the led is set to ON
                and "list s:" when it set to OFF. Note: this feature
                was not initially meant to transform UAE as a dir-like
                programm :-) A more serious example can be found in
                UAEGUI.rexx where you'll find something like:

                        address UAE feedback LED_DF0 PORT UAEGUI,
                         CMD_ON  "switch ID DF0 ATTRS 0x8042654b 1",
                         CMD_OFF "switch ID DF0 ATTRS 0x8042654b 0"

                That makes the gui led follow any state changements.

                If <eventname> is not a name of a led (ON_EXIT,
                NAME_DF0, ...) then UAE will only use the CMD_ON
                command. For events like NAME_DF0, <cmd> can bear a
                '%s'. It'll be replaced by the name of the
                correponding filedisk. For example, the following code:

                        address UAE feedback NAME_DF0 PORT UAEGUI,
                         CMD "popasl ID NDF0 CONTENT %s"

                Will change the content of the popasl gadged whose ID
                is NDF0 automatically when the drivename is modified.

                The event ON_EXIT is used when uae is about to exit.
                You can use it to automatically close an external GUI
                when UAE ends:
                
                        address UAE feedback ON_EXIT PORT UAEGUI,
                         CMD "quit"
                        /* sends "quit" to UAEGUI when UAE exits */
