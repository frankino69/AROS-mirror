.uaerc			Basic uae configuration file to start extending from,
			expecting the folder "Emulation/shared" Amiga Forever
			to be copied to PROGDIR: (System:Extras/Emu/E-UAE).
e-uae-0.8.27-aros.diff	Very small diff to patch "configure".
mmakefile.src		Metamake file to fetch (from Richard Drummonds size)
			and build e-uae from the current source tarball.
			Additional files are copied to PROGDIR: to have
			almost the same tree as in the aros bin distribution
			available on Richards site.
Readme			This file.
README.AmigaOS		Richard Drummonds comments about the current state
			of e-uae on various flavours of AmigaOS. That one
			is included with the aros binary distribution but
			is not in the current source tarball, also copied
			to PROGDIR:.
			
Building
--------

As usual just type "make contrib-euae" in the top level of your aros
source tree having an open internet connection or let the automatic
contrib build do its work in case you have all or parts of it. The
build was tested on linux hosted for x86 and ppc both without a cross
compiler. The x86  version seems to work fine. ppc does not yet probably
because of some missing math functions (actually they are linked in
from native libgcc, but the ppc elf loader cannot handle those weird
*PLT* relocations). Probably a cross compiler will help here.
