The AROS irc channels have now been moved to Freenode. You can connect
here by using irc.freenode.net (it picks a random server) or find a 
server on <a href="http://www.freenode.net">www.freenode.net</a>.

The Freenode net is also used by most open source projects, so we're
hoping a lot of people who found it too much of a hassle to join us
on EFnet will do it here.

This IRC net supports longer nicknames, nick registration and a lot of
other things aswell. 

The channel name is the same: #aros

Join #aros on irc.freenode.net today!
