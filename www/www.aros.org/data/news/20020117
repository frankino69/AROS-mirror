The big news of the day ? Look at this URL:
<a href="http://aros.sourceforge.net/">http://aros.sourceforge.net/</a>
Yes, AROS is now one of the many, many, many (more than 32'000 last
time I looked) projects on 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> ! That means
we can probably solve many of our bandwidth problems :-)
You can find 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aros/">the normal SourceForge page
here</a>. We're now integrating most of the links and stuff
from our own homepage into the SF system.

Georg Steger continued to port changes by Stephan Rupprecht back
into AROS. This time, it's the OS 3.9 gradientslider. Also, a bug
in InstallClipRegion() was fixed. He added a safety check in the
ReqTools file requester to prevent a possible recursive hook call
and several other bugfixes in there. Our ReqTools is now V39.4.

Adam Chodorowski overworked the build of Python for AROS (only one
big MMakefile is used now which is more flexible and clean than
what we had before).

Henning Kiel fixed a the build script for adflib to work on Cygwin
and made the build process less verbose.
