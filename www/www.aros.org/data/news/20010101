Happy New Year, everyone ! :-)

Adam Chodorowski began to hunt a bug in RAW: and committed a skeleton
for a skeleton for bsdsocket.library. The includes are there but
all functions are empty. Then, he improved his LoadWB command. Henning Kiel
helped him and then fixed all the lint in the docs (email addresses, etc).
Georg Steger began to improve the RAW mode of the console. Johan Alfredsson
fixed a bug in the c.lib and C:Dir.
