The AROS Snapshots are back!

That's right folks, since today you can download again the daily snapshots of the sources and binaries
of AROS, <a href="snapshots.html">here</a>.

However, remember that the AROS team doesn't officially support these snapshots, they are given to you
"as is", although bug reports are very welcome and should be submitted using the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=439463&group_id=43586&func=browse">bug tracker</a>,
and patches should be submitted using the
<a HREF="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=439465&group_id=43586&func=browse">patch tracker</a>.
