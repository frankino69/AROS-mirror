Some new software is ported to AROS: The freetype library
(<A HREF="http://www.freetype.org">www.freetype.org</A>),
BGUI and SnoopDOS. Also DOpus becomes more and more usable.
Many bugs in the Gfx.HIDD were fixed and there is now a
quite usable cybergrafx.library. Also the first version
of an IDE driver for x86/Native was committed. Also
a trackdisk.device is there, so we can start porting
a filesystem to AROS.

As for BGUI, we would like someone who will keep it alive on
Amiga (that is, make sure that our changes don't make BGUI
unusable on the Amiga). If you want to help, please contact
<A HREF="mailto:digulla@aros.org">digulla@aros.org</A>.

Also please note that my PGP-key has changed (2048bit instead
of only 1024bit for better security :-). You find my new version
<A HREF="pubkey.asc">here</A> (Shift-Click on the link to download).

Lastly, my Amiga SDK has arrived. You can expect an AROS Amie/Native
but probably not soon.
