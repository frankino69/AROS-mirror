There is now a mailing list for announcements only (basically the same you
can read here :-) Follow 
<A HREF="http://www.aros.org/mailman/listinfo/aros-announce">this link to
subscribe</A>.

Also, the sources for Scalos V2 have been handed over to AROS. Jörg
is lacking the time to give Scalos the attention it deserves and
therefore allowed us to include his work into our contrib area.
No official representative for this work has been elected, yet,
so this is your chance to contribute.
