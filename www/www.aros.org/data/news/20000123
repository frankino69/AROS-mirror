There are two good articles about AROS on the net. The first one is
<A HREF="http://elwoodb.free.fr/AROS">here</A> (it's an interview
with Aaron Digulla) and the other one is
<A HREF="http://amiga.eden.it/dossier/aros/aros_eng.html">here</A>
(background and some detail info on AROS). This article is a bit
older but it's written very well (and it's also available in
<A HREF="http://amiga.eden.it/dossier/aros/aros.html">italian</A>).
