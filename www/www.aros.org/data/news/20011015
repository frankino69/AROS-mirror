Fabio Alemagna improved his new region functions a bit more.
They are now faster than their X11 equivalents (Yes, the X11
equivalents are compiled into the client and don't need to go
over the network to the X server :-) Also the region handling
code can now use memory pools for even better performance.

notices uniform.
