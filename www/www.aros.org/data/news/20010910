Fabio Alemagna is taking a break from the project because other things
have become more important for him ([Aaron] Or my guess would be that he didn't
give enough attention to those other things because he did work so much
on AROS ;-). The whole AROS team thanks him for his effort and wishes
him best luck with whatever he intends to do now.

Sebastian Heutling optimized <code>LoadSeg()</code>.

Georg Steger fixed a bug in <code>NewCliProc()</code> and in the
keyboard driver (trying to update the LEDs while the keyboard interrupts
where active leads to a freeze). He also fixed a bug in putimage in
the vga.hidd which corrupted the map in the Locale prefs when the
window was moved outside of the screen. <code>BlitColorExpansion</code>
in the vga.hidd is now faster and some small coordinate bugs have
been squished.

Henning Kiel fixed typos and added prototypes for <code>DosDoIO()</code>
where necessary.

Iain Templeton added some new macros to
<filename>arossupport/system.h</filename>.
