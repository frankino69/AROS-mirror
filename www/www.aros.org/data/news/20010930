Kjetil Svalastog Matheussen improved the <code>PolyDraw()</code> routine a bit.
And he fixed demowin which used this routine in a wrong way.
Radium is now part of the default build. Doesn't work completely,
yet, though.

Peter Eriksson worked on Font prefs (fixed a typo in the Swedish
translation) and the ReqTools pref (the Escape key, Ctrl-C and the
close button now close the window).

Nicholai Benalal began to merge MorphOS patches into asl.library.

Adam Chodorowski began porting <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
the first real programming language for AROS. He can already run simple
scripts. Good work ! Now we'll see if we can squeeze enough space out
of the bootdisk to include it :-) He also fixed a bug in
<code>strchr()</code>.

Fabio Alemagna implemented <code>umask()</code>.
