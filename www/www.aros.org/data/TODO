TODO

- Make a logo contest

o Check if the contents of a page has changes and update it.

The current scheme updates the pages if the contents (meat) changes
but it should also update the page if the linkbox and the navlinks
change.

- Make the scripts which create the various pages more independent of
each other.

- Create a list of "recently changed" pages.

o Convert the C source files into hyperlinked HTML docs.
    - Generate lxr.conf from site.conf.

o Add support for AutoDocs.
    - Navigation in the autodocs is clumsy: prev/next is missing,
	"Top" doesn't move to the library
    * See also is useless

- Think about a way to update the news section remotely (CGI ? Form ?
EMail ?)

- Publish the changelogs on the web.

o Merge old docs
    - devinfo_inside.src
    - devinfo_outside.src
    - differences.src
    o filesys.src
    - hidd.src
    - missing.src
    * style.src
    (- core.src)
    * hidd-intro.src
    * hidd-model.src
    * ideas.src
    * included.src
    * faq.src

- Mirror Matts Diskimage

DONE

* Generate TOC for each page

* Implement filtermakefile

* Make the current item in the navbar stand out

* Add Link to edenmarket (those guys host our server for free :-)

* List of links:
    * Homepages
    * Less related

* the mailto-link for e.g. cvs-passwords could look like this :

    <a href="mailto:digulla@aros.org?subject=Access to AROS CVS
    Server&body=Please add [my_login] [password]</a>

* Create a list of contributors and publish it

* If a news item is very long, include only part of it in the news page
and create a sub-page with the rest of the text.
-> Solution: Write smaller news items :-) This should be simple by
updating the news section more regularily.

* Move the graph generation out of gensite into the makefile and make
it optional. This probably includes creating a way to make every
aspect of the site optional (screenshots, etc).
-> Just define GNUPLOT to empty or don't define it at all and the graphs
will not be generated.
