To generate the AROS web size, you must have the following software
installed:

- Python 1.5.2 or better (http://www.python.org/)
- GNU Make (should already be installed. http://www.fsf.org/)
- ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/)
- gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.org/)

Optionally, you can have installed:

- The Python Imaging Library - PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

If you have these, just run make and follow the instructions.

Here is some background to help you find things:

The Makefile does all the magic of copying the necessary files from
the AROS source tree, converting them and calling gensite (a Python
script) which generates the HTML glue. Since no CGIs or active
content is used, you can generate most of the stuff and will not
need a web server to view it.

To check if the pages can be served OK, you must have Apache (any
Apache after 1.0 should be OK). Just include the file apache.conf
which is generated by running make. You will find instructions on
how to modify the Apache config inside the file apache.conf. Next,
you must add this line to /etc/hosts:

    127.0.0.1	www2.aros.org

(or append www2.aros.org to the line "127.0.0.1 localhost"). Now
you can access the local copy with http://www2.aros.org/. If it
doesn't work, tell your web browser to directly connect to this
site (in Netscape: Menu "Edit", "Preferences...", open "Advanced",
click on "Proxies", choose "Manual proxy configuration", click
on "View", append ",www2.aros.org" to the field "No Proxy for".

The script gensite will do most of the work. First, it will read
some global configs from aros.rc and site.conf. Next, it will
generate every part of the web site (news section, status page,
other docs, screenshots, download page, snapshots, links, etc).

Most stuff will read other files and directories (for example,
the news generator will check the news/ directory and the
snapshots generator will check for snapshots in the snapshots
directory, generate thumbnails, etc). Check the docs for the
respective generator for details. The main page (index.html)
is generated by the news generator.

gensite uses HTMLgen 2.2 which was developed by Robin Friedrich
and can be downloaded from http://starship.python.net/lib.html.
Since not everyone who has Python installed, I've included the
necessary files from HTMLgen (HTMLcolors.py, HTMLgen.py, ImageH.py,
and imgsize.py). Nonetheless, they are not part of AROS and are
included just for your convenience.
