We need your help!
==================

We have quite few active developers, which unfortunately means that progress
is quite slow. We simply need more people to help us out! There is a huge
number of tasks that are in need of a dedicated developer. They range from
large projects to small ones, from hardware hacking, through high-level system
programming to application programming. There is basically something for
everyone who wishes to contribute, regardless of how proficient they are in
coding!

For those of you who aren't programmers, there are still plenty of tasks that
you can help with! This includes writing documentation, translating programs
and documentation to other languages, creating nice graphics and hunting
bugs. These tasks are just as important as coding!
