- What ?

This is the ongoing list of "things" happening in the AROS project, mostly the
notable system improvements. All AROS developers are encouraged to briefly
state items, not necessarily "belonging" to them. First come, first write.
IRC discussion topics are welcome here, as #aros is very active/useful. So IRC
addicts may be more inclined to update this file :)

Each item above the most recent status update can get considered, but won't be
necessarily used. It's up to the Status Update Redactor of the Week/Month to
choose and expand items.

- Why ?

The goal of this file is to get a complete, uptodate, view of what's going on,
not to have extensive descriptions. In due time, this will serve as a reminder
and as a basis for public status updates (marked by "=" lines below).

- Who ?

See cvs log for who commited what. The people "simply" reporting items are not
relevant; those who are really relevant are marked by login between square
brackets ("[]").

- Let's roll (antichronological order, add things on top, not bottom) :
