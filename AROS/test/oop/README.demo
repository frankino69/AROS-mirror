This OOP system is much like BOOPSI, but it uses
a hash table instead of switch().

This allows for some optimizations:
- Skipping unimplemented class calls.
- Obtaining single methods, and call them directly.

The demo shows how fast these two invocation methods
are compared to each other. This test is not meant
to say much, because I don't have a large class
hierarchy, yet (so methods are well spread through
the hash table in this demo).
